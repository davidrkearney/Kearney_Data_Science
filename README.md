## Data Science blog resources

This repository contains extra resources like code  and Jupyter notebooks that are useful for reproducing posts from the my data science blog, _found [here](http://davidkearney.xyz/Kearney_Data_Science/)_




The repository is structured as folders whose name is the same as the blog post file.
That is, the blog post `http://davidkearney.xyz/Kearney_Data_Science/2020/10/26/blog-post.html` will have a corresponding `_notebooks/2020-10-26-blog-post.ipynb` file in the repo with the needed content.
