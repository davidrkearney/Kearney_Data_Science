I am David Raymond Kearney, political economist by training, data scientist by profession.


As a data scientist, I create automated member and provider engagement campaigns that leverage e-mail, IVR, SMS and live calls to increase medication adherence.

I also design experiments and employ randomized control trials to improve campaigns by identifying the most effective campaign variants, and productionlize machine learning models to identify members at risk of behaving in a way that contributes to poor health outcomes and most likely to benefit from campaigns. 


I got my Ph.D. at Duke University, where my research focused on applying econometric and statistical techniques to explain and predict the allocation of fiscal transfers.

This [site](http://davidraymondkearney.com/Kearney_Data_Science/), will cover spark, h2o. hive and data science using python.
