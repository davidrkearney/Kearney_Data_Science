I am David Raymond Kearney, political economist by training, data scientist by profession. I grew up in Iowa and have lived there, China, Durham, Vietnam and Chicago.

I create automated engagement campaigns, designed experiments and randomized control trials, and productionlize machine learning models. 

I got my Ph.D. at Duke University, where my research focused on applying econometric and statistical techniques to explain and predict the allocation of fiscal transfers.
