0,2000,"""Institutions at the Domestic/International Nexus: the political-military  origins of military effectiveness, strategic integration and war","Civil-military relations are frequently studied as if they operate on two distinct levels of analysis. Some scholars emphasize an internal game concerned with leadership survival and regime transition.  Others focus on an external dimension of international conflict and war-fighting.  This project explores linkages across these two levels of analysis. I find that the armed forces' role in a state's internal politics affects the development of its military institutions, sometimes in ways counterproductive to the state's international relations. Among this study's most provocative claims is that those states most prone to war, are often those least prepared to fight.
        At the project's core is a theory about how states develop different military institutions, and how those institutions affect their propensities to fight and win wars on the inter-state battlefield. Drawing on insights from the new-institutionalism and building-on extant principal-agent approaches, I reframe the issue of ""civilian control"" as a problem of institutional development. I argue that the military's position in a state's ruling coalition, and its internal unity (""military power"") affect its leaders' abilities to force concessions in bargaining over institutions. Underlying differences between political and military leaders over policy outcomes (""preference divergence"") fuel these disputes. Different configurations of military and political power and preferences yield different institutional settings. In chapter two of the study, I identify five distinct settings, distinguishing them according to the complexity and coherence of the rules and procedures observed in each, and whose preferences they privilege (military leaders, politicians or neither). 
        These institutions vitally shape processes of strategic assessment and review and hence the strategies political leaders pursue in inter-state relations. In chapter seven, I offer one of the first empirical tests of informational theories of war. As the repositories of information about their own and other states' military capabilities, military leaders and their agencies supply vital intelligence to political leaders. Active Competition, which I define as an institutional setting of high preference divergence and shared political-military power, produces biased information, heightening the propensity that political leaders will choose strategies that culminate in war. Inadequate review and assessment and military pressure can further complicate strategic decision-making. Thus, in settings of Latent Competition (low-preference divergence and shared power) complacency and poor institutionalization impede critical analysis.  These states are doomed to pursue military strategies at odds with their political goals, significantly undermining their leaders' abilities to defend against threats or realize their ambitions in the international arena. Finally, below the strategic level, a state's military institutions affect the organizational structures and leadership of the armed forces in preparing for war. In chapter three, I offer predictions for how the five ideal-typical institutional settings derived in chapter two affect states' propensities to integrate military strategy with political goals, to avoid war, and to win the wars they fight. 
        I test my hypotheses with a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of Egypt in the 1960s and 1970s, for which I rely on both primary sources (memoirs, interviews from two research trips) as well as the secondary literature. This case exhibits interesting variation in political-military relations over time. In addition, the Middle East is often neglected as a testing ground for theoretical political science. 
        In the volume's empirical chapters, I first trace the origins of Egypt's political-military institutions in two periods, 1961-67 and 1967-1981. From 1961 to 1967 I find that divergent preferences and ""shared"" power critically undermined the internal coordination and quality of the military organization, as well as coordination and assessment across the political and military arenas. Subsequent changes in the military's position in the coalition and its internal cohesion shifted the balance of political-military power.  President Sadat was able to exercise prerogatives over the military establishment unknown to Nasser in the mid-1960s, which facilitated dramatic improvements in Egypt's military effectiveness.        My study also offers new insight into the origins of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, a war that no one anticipated in the spring of 1967, but that profoundly altered the borders and politics of the region. I argue that Egypt's military institutions undermined the quality and assessment of information about military capabilities. Nasser's ""demands"" of Israel in the May/June 1967 crisis, based in part on flawed estimates of the likely outcome of war, eclipsed the bargaining space available for peaceful settlement, prompting Israel's attack. Contesting cognitive and other explanations, I argue that Egypt's institutions are vital to understanding why Nasser, a seasoned and skilled political leader, pursued a war he was bound to lose. 
        A final chapter on Egypt illuminates the domestic political underpinnings of Anwar Sadat's ambitious grand strategy, including the country's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Egypt's institutions in the late 1960s and early 1970s limited military influence over decision-making and other institutional prerogatives. The October 1973 war, with which Sadat signaled Israel and the superpowers his resolve to win back lost territories, could not have been launched without prior changes in the country's military institutions. Similarly, the success of the ensuing military disengagement agreements, the Camp David accords and the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty depended on Sadat's ability to overrule dissenters in the military and, through his powers of appointment and dismissal, create a command willing and able to carry through his controversial initiatives.
        In addition to the Egypt cases, supplemental case studies were chosen to increase variation in my independent variables and introduce regional and temporal variation into the analysis. A British case (1902-1918) explores the improvements in political-military planning which rendered the country better prepared for the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 than for any prior war in its history. The case then demonstrates how British military leaders used their political leverage over the Lloyd George government to force concessions over key strategic decisions during the Great War. A German case (1890-1914) underscores the pathological effects on war propensity of environments that lack fora for critical review and assessment. Through the information they provided to Austria about German preferences, Wilhelmine institutions heightened the country's propensity for war in July 1914.  A Pakistani case (1997-1999) explores how competition between political and military leaders rendered the state prone to destabilizing policies and war. In summer 1999, Pakistan came dangerously close to fighting a war against India, an adversary far superior in conventional forces. A Turkey case (1996-1999) shows how military dominance in decision-making inspired continuity and predictability in the country's military strategies. Interestingly, when a potentially explosive crisis with Syria flared in October 1998 over the latter's support for Kurdish rebels, the dispute was resolved peacefully, with just a smattering of commentary in the international press.
        This project makes numerous contributions to the academic and policy literature. It identifies new causal pathways between war and civil-military relations. Drawing on rationalist theories, it shows how the information military institutions provide to a state's own leaders about its and other states' capabilities, and to its adversaries about its preferences affect its war propensity. It adds to our knowledge of how states create fighting power, and how civil-military relations affect their performances on the battlefield. 
        For policy analysts, the project provides a benchmark for judging ""healthy"" civil-military relations, arguing that too much friction (yielding  alienation at the political-military apex) and too little (and hence complacency) are ""unhealthy."" The project speaks to contemporary policy and academic debates about the nature of the so-called ""rogue state"": the study illuminates the conditions under which civil-military relations render authoritarian states more or less dangerous to international peace and stability. Finally, the study offers an essential antidote to ""constitutional determinism."" It highlights the domestic conditions under which foreign civil-military institutions will ""take"" in newly democratizing countries.

1,2000,Born to Lose and Doomed to Survive: State Death and Survival in the International System,"Under what conditions do states die, or exit the international system?  This question is of key importance for international relations scholars and policymakers.  By understanding which states are more likely to die, we can assess the risks faced by states and predict which, if any, actions might pre-empt a state death.  Furthermore, since state death is usually violent, an analysis of past state deaths will help us identify potential instabilities and outbreaks of violence in the future.  
        I define state death as the loss of foreign policy making power to another state.   I argue that state death can be predicted by examining the level of threat facing a state.  States in danger zones – for example, states that are caught between two strong rivals – face dim prospects.  The probability that buffer states will be conquered or occupied is high.  Conversely, states in non-threatening environments – those, for example, in a world where the protection of territorial sovereignty is a widely-held norm – will probably not exit the system, and will almost certainly not exit the system violently.
        My argument challenges claims that lie at the heart of two competing paradigms in international relations scholarship.  Scholars from both approaches predict that state attributes – rather than state context – are most predictive of state survival and death.  Neorealists have argued that states must act as if they were rational, or they will be selected out of the system. Constructivists, on the other hand, assert that states that are perceived to be less “legitimate” will be most likely to die.  Neorealists and constructivists alike claim that the death rate of states is low; they take this claim to prove that states do behave as if they were rational, or that the international system has been socially constructed as a benign environment for states.
        Empirical analysis contradicts this conventional wisdom.  The death rate of states is not low.  Of 210 states from 1816 to the present, 69 (about 30%) have exited the international system, and most have exited in the wake of violence.  Furthermore, tests using original data that expand the Correlates of War list of members of the interstate system strongly indicate that context trumps state behavior or attributes.  Buffer states are in a very high risk group, while states that survive past 1945 face virtually no threats to their survival.  I argue that a norm protecting states’ territorial sovereignty is only entrenched after World War II, although it can be traced at least as far back as the founding of the League of Nations.  
        Does a post-1945 norm protecting states’ territorial sovereignty mean that the international system is less competitive today than formerly?  If we expand our definition of “death” to include regimes and leaders as well as states, we find that competitive international pressures seem to have been redirected away from states and toward regimes and leaders.  As the rate of violent state death has declined, the incidence of external replacement of regimes and leaders has increased.  This trend points to the key policy implication that publics should no longer equate their leaders or regimes with their states; the state is likely to survive beyond its parts.
        State death in the international system is a critically important subject that has not been examined previously.  My analysis of this question debunks the notion that state death is a rare event in international relations.  I also show that geography and environment are more determinative of state survival than state behavior or attributes.  These results hold significant theoretical value, but can also help us to evaluate the limits of power and to better examine a number of issues that pervade the post-Cold War world: the likelihood of war over territory, the importance of sovereignty, and the power of nationalism.

2,2000,The significance of “allegiance” in international relations,"My dissertation employs original and secondary survey research in answering conceptual, descriptive and causal questions about allegiance in international politics.  Hypothesizing that allegiance is not best understood in terms of “nationalism vs. internationalism,” I demonstrate the empirical coherence of five basic “levels” of allegiance (localism, patriotism, civilizationism, multiculturalism and universalism) as well as the differentiation of allegiance across issue areas (economics, politics, security and culture).  I compare these real-world “patterns” of allegiance with numerous ideal types discussed in the theoretical literature, paying particular attention to canonical and contemporary political philosophy.
        After considering whether various categories of allegiance are or are not ""salient,"" I discuss the more fundamental question of what people's allegiances actually are.  Along with attending to cross-national differentiation in allegiance, I pay particular attention to demographic predictors (e.g., gender, age, race, income, education and left-right orientation).  I uncover numerous findings that run counter to conventional wisdom.  
I next examine trends in allegiance over time.  Various authors have argued that national patriotism will soon give way to localism, regionalism, universalism, or something else.  I consider the extent to which each of these claims is supported by empirical evidence.  While the analysis of this section of the dissertation is particularly rudimentary, I offer my own hesitant predictions for the future of the nation-state. 
         Most interesting for scholars of international relations, however, may be my preliminary consideration of allegiance as a predictor of international outcomes – i.e., my attempt to test not only the “nationalism-war connection” but also the connection between conflict behavior and other modes of allegiance.  In the case of “localism,” notably, I attempt to predict not only inter-state but also intra-state conflict.  Although I turn up numerous statistically significant findings, my primary recommendation is for more detailed cross-national research.  (This should likewise aid in the analysis of allegiance as a predictor of economic, political and cultural “outcomes.”)
After linking my findings to a future agenda for opinion research in IR, I conclude the dissertation by showing how my account of allegiance relates to particular foreign policy issues.

3,2000,The significance of “allegiance” in international relations,"
This study revises prevailing interpretations of Franco-American relations during the arly 1960s that rest on an oversimplified premise of French resistance to U .S. hegemony. Current monographs focus excessively on personalities, alternately chastising French President Charles de Gaulle for nationalistic intransigence or John F. Kennedy for willfully imposing U.S. policies on Western Europe. This study employs a broad array of French archival sources, documents from U.S. government agencies, and British and West German materials. This comprehensive multinational approach demonstrates that the structure and dynamics of the Franco-American bilateral relationship were embedded in complex multilateral relationships. Difficulties between Kennedy and de Gaulle were the outcome of a series of mutually reinforcing strategic and economic dilemmas, driven by domestic agendas, and shaped by differing conceptions about the double containment of Germany, and the Soviet Union. Three primary questions--Berlin, European integration, international finance-- were linked in the minds of the Western leaders. Monetary issues became entangled with NATO strategy, Britain's EEC candidacy became enmeshed with nuclear sharing, and the on-going Berlin crisis served as a backdrop to issues. Kennedy's and de Gaulle's competing geostrategies were hemmed in by East-West crises, set against the difficulties posed by decolonization, and shaped by divergent domestic demands of their economies.
The larger historical significance of this study lies in three areas. Western expedients to prop up the tottering financial edifice of Bretton Woods were merely part of a series of ""fire extinguisher"" methods pursued intermittently from 1958 to the closing of the gold window in 1971. Franco-American disputes during the early 1960s also provide a window into the movement for European unity. Finally, although the Cold War is over, this analysis addresses critical strategic issues within the Western alliance that affected the intensity of the superpower conflict. This study reveals the key dynamics operating within NA TO over the handling of the Berlin Crisis, directing German security issues, and meeting national demands for nuclear weapons. Kennedy and de Gaulle's contrasting strategies for Western Europe, which ultimately stood at an impasse, reveal a more variegated and multipolar world in the early 1960s than previous scholars have depicted.

4,2000,"Truth-Telling and Mythmaking in Post-Soviet Russia: Historical Ideas, Mass Education, and Interstate Conflict","Can distorted and pernicious ideas about history exacerbate violent or potentially-violent conflict among states, and if so, how? What are the most likely sources of such ideas? Is there any way to prevent such ideas from emerging, or to dampen their more malevolent effects? This dissertation answers these questions by examining popular historical ideas in post-Soviet Russia and their impact on Russian foreign policy.It is commonly assumed that historical ideas serve only as fodder for propaganda, or to help political elites justify decisions already made rationally, consistent with structural constraints and strategic interests. This study provides significant support for the countervailing view: historical ideas and beliefs, in and of themselves, have a very real impact on political behavior. Especially pernicious historical myths that are commonly held by publics and elites can be an important source of interstate conflict. A long history of scholarly writing on nationalism assumes that distorted, mythologized history can be dangerous. However, we still don't understand exactly how pernicious ideas lead to interstate conflict, if at all. Discussions about the threat of nationalism and pernicious ideas have been based largely on folk theory or broad assertion. This study proposes a number of hypotheses on the malevolent effects of pernicious ideas that are empirically grounded in the recent experiences of post-Soviet Russia, and suggests ways to ameliorate those effects. Specifically, pernicious historical ideas are found to precipitate or exacerbate conflict in two general ways: The first is through ""emotional"" mechanisms, whereby pernicious myths instill resentment and animosity , and manifest grievances over real or perceived injustices. These feelings then lead to violent retaliation or demands for apologies, restitution, reparations or other symbolic gestures that raise tensions, or lead to confrontational or antagonistic policy choices. At best they reinforce existing animosity; at worst they precipitate hostilities. In either case, they increase the likelihood of deadly or potentially deadly conflict. The second way is through ""cognitive"" mechanisms. Here pernicious myths foster ethnic and nationalist stereotypes and negative or false images about others, or create assumptions and beliefs about international politics, the causes of war and peace, and one's own and other's national interests. By serving as a cognitive lens or filter through which information is processed and decisions are made, these images and assumptions -reflected in distorted and pernicious views of history--can cause significant national misperceptions that lead to confrontational or antagonistic policies. The study identifies popular views of history by systematically analyzing the entire catalog of Soviet and post-Soviet Russian history textbooks. It examines three cases of wars, conflicts and interventions that have been especially prone to Russian historical mythmaking: World War II; Soviet western interventions in 1939-40; and the Russo-Turkish wars of the 19th century. Comparison of these cases across and within Soviet and post-Soviet texts, and analysis of the ideological and institutional changes in education and textbook publishing, demonstrate that certain pernicious historical ideas and images are widely-held and deeply-ingrained among the Russian public and elite. Russia's portrayal of these wars and interventions--whether Russia is the victim or perpetrator of aggression, or whether events occurred in the Soviet past or more distant imperial period--is dominated by self-glorifying, self-exculpating, other-denigrating and victimization myths. An examination of recent Russian foreign policy behavior in two regions--the Baltic and the Balkans--illustrates how these historical ideas have shaped Russian images and assumptions that have precipitated and exacerbated conflict in those regions. This dissertation clarifies and extends arguments advanced in the theoretical literature on the sources of national misperceptions, as well as by constructivist theories of international relations. It also speaks directly to concerns about potential dangers of Russian nationalism.

5,2000,"Building a Cape Fear Metropolis: Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, and the  Sandhills of North Carolina","My dissertation examines the cultural and economic impact of military bases in theAmerican South, 1898-1945, through a case study of Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, and the Sandhills region of North Carolina--in essence, the upper Cape Fear Valley. The significance of mydissertation comes from the emphasis on culture and society .Other studies, largely economic reports, have considered the impact of military facilities on communities. My work, however, examines how the quest for and economic impact of a base, both perceived and real, shaped the culture and society of a region. This dissertation is about the upper Cape Fear Valley as much as it is about a military post. The interaction of the land, the people, the military, and the base, with the resulting impact of the fort and region upon one another, and particularly the impact of the military on the surrounding culture, forms the central theme of this thesis. My work fits well into four historiographical currents: the general history of the New South, or the South since Reconstruction; southern economic history; urban history and the martial metropolis; and, the South's culture of militarism. While not discounting the broadert hemes of southern history since Reconstruction, I intend to ground this study in the historiography of southern economic history .This dissertation deepens historians' understanding of the diversity and complexity of the New South movement and demonstrates how and why towns actively pursued government largess as a vehicle for economic development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Contrary to the political rhetoric of the 1890s, southern towns embraced federal spending in the quest for local economic growth. Fayetteville's leaders hoped to use federally  funded projects to encourage private sector initiatives. As a result, Fayetteville eventually replaced its market-driven economy with one based upon federal spending. The assumptions of this new economy have profoundly influenced economic decision-making in Cumberland County and the Sandhills during the twentieth century .This transformation (at the state level) has been well documented for the post- World War II Sunbelt era, but not for the pre-World War I period. Historians James Cobb and Bruce Schulman are certainly correct in their assessments of the ""selling of the South"" and the role of federal dollars in state economic development plans. However, neither scholar examines the precedent set at the turn of the century by small towns and communities throughout the former Confederate states. Evidence and not theory drives my work, although the theoretical assumptions of anthropologists, geographers, and sociologists have sharpened my thinking and have contributed to the interdisciplinary nature of my research. Readings in economic anthropology gave insight into non-capitalist systems. Geography forced me to think spatially and consider how and why the rhythms of life and pace of human interaction varied within the region under consideration. If scholars consider my work to be solely a work of military history, then I will have failed. The story of Fayetteville, the Sandhills, and Fort Bragg is more than military history. It is the history of the New South, of culture, of economic development, of urbanization, of the expansion of federal power. It is the history of a region trying to make something of itself, although not everyone in the region agreed with the plan. It is also the history of a region obsessed with its own history, both real and imagined. And lastly, it is a history of modern warfare and technology. Until the experience of World War I, the United States Army had little need for an artillery post that consumed 130,000 acres of sand and hills and assorted pine trees.",Domestic Military History,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,2000,"The Glories and the Sadness: Shaping the national Memory of the First World War in Great Britain, Canada and Australia"," In my dissertation I compare the ways in which Britons, Canadians and Australians during the inter-war years imagined and rendered, within their respective cultures the experience of the  Great War.  My aim is to analyze the emergence in each country of  distinctive ""myths"" related to the nation's war experience and to locate such phenomena within the context of evolving conceptions of national identity.        The last 10-15 years have seen a growing interest among scholars in exploring the Great War as a cultural phenomenon.  For Great Britain, Canada and Australia there is currently a large body of scholarship that deals with the First World War as an event ""remembered"" within the nation's culture and/or collective consciousness.  However, no study has ever expressly compared how the memory of the Great War evolved in all three nations between 1914 and 1939.  These years were characterized by the development of nationally distinct memories of the war that belied obvious similarities between the Motherland and its dominions in terms of heritage and outlook.  This process marked a pivotal moment in the formation of each country's national identity.        In my work I establish that the inter-war years in Great Britain saw the emergence and eventual triumph of a narrative version of the war experience that emphasized the human, material, social and spiritual cost of the conflict.  In Canada and Australia, by contrast, the dominant narrative of the war focused on what was achieved in those years by the nation and its soldiers, rather than on what was lost in the process, despite the fact that the material cost of the war for each dominion was proportionally comparable to that experienced by Britain.  Basically, in Canada and Australia, the narrative of loss was successfully marginalized during the inter-war years, while in Britain it proved a compelling alternative to more positive, celebratory interpretations of the war experience.        Until now, almost all scholarship on the memory of the Great War in Britain has weighed in on the debate, initiated and embodied by Paul Fussell (The Great War and Modern Memory), over whether or not the First World War heralded a paradigm shift in western culture, from the romantic, ""traditional"" positivism of the 19th century to the ironic ""modern"" existentialism of the 20th century.  Like Fussell, those scholars interested in either supporting or refuting him typically draw their evidence from the works of individuals hailing from a narrow, elite, highly-literate spectrum of British society, without ever discussing the issues of class, racial and gender identity that helped shape not only their response to the experience of the Great War, but also the response of the British public to their interpretations of that experience.  Similarly, scholarship concerned with the memory of the war in the dominions generally stresses the role of the conflict in helping to create a sense of national identity, while ignoring the question of why criticism of this celebratory narrative was so muted within colonial culture.  In my dissertation I examine how the articulation and establishment of dominant ""national"" narratives of the war were decisively linked to developing understandings of British, Canadian and Australian identity.  In so doing I challenge the notions of both Fussell and his critics that the memory of the First World War necessarily either heralded the birth of the modern or confirmed the continuity of tradition. By focusing on the process through which that memory was constructed on a national level, I argue that the triumph of one or the other ideal within a society was the result of ideological contests within particular countries, and that the outcomes of these contests were contingent on a number of political, social and cultural factors.  I believe this interpretation to be more nuanced and balanced than any thus far presented by scholars of this topic.        While I analyze some of the same novels, poems, films and art previously mined by Fussell and other scholars, I venture beyond the boundaries of these traditional sources and look at a wide variety of cultural products designed to appeal to, or represent, the ""mainstream"" of British and dominion society: Text and imagery associated with war memorials and commemorative rituals, juvenile and other forms of ""popular"" literature, school textbooks, etc.  The memory of the First World War was not exclusively produced in the realm of ""high culture,"" and only by utilizing evidence drawn from a broader and more representative range of material is it possible to avoid presenting a fundamentally flawed interpretation of this phenomenon.",Culture,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,2000,What leads longstanding adversaries to engage in conflict resolution," This dissertation develops a socio-psychoanalytic model to help further ourunderstanding of this question.  Focusing on the case of Israel pursuingpeace talks with the PLO leading to the 1993 Oslo agreement, I argue that when a state's policies conflict with its self-image, over time, the polity experiences a 'cognitive-emotional dissonance' that leads policy makers to radically shift their state's foreign policy.  In the case of Israel, that country's actions through the Lebanon War and the Intifada, in which the state was cast as an 'aggressor' in the eyes of theinternational community and by significant components of Israeli society, led elites to experience a dissonance between their policy actions and the Israeli role-identity of what I term a 'defensive warrior.'

14,2001,A School for the Nation: Military  Institutions and the Boundaries of Nationality,"Beginning in Europe in the latter half of the nineteenth century and continuing into the twentieth, the armed forces have enjoyed popularity among both scholars and state leaders as nation-defining devices. Yet the belief that the military has the capacity to redraw the boundaries of the surrounding political community is often asserted but rarely systematically explored. This dissertation lays out a theory of militaries as nation-builders: it examines whether, how, and when the military’s manpower policies shape the path and success of minorities’ struggles for effective citizenship. 
In contrast to individualist and apolitical models (notably, military socialization and the contact hypothesis), the dissertation’s theoretical approach is grounded in an awareness of the social networks in which individuals are embedded and of the political contest through which groups negotiate the definition of the nation, and it marries rationalist and discursive approaches to explain when and how the armed forces’ policies produce effective citizenship. First, minorities often face substantial uncertainty regarding the majority’s likely response to their citizenship demands, and the consequences of poor estimates may be severe. Under identifiable conditions, the military’s participation policies can prove a powerful signal that helps minorities overcome these informational chasms and shapes the goals, strategies, and timing of their political mobilization. Second, the discursive frame minorities deploy in part determines the effectiveness of such claims-making: when the discourse of “military sacrifice and just rewards” is resonant within the larger political culture, even small politically insignificant groups may be able to shape the political agenda. 
More broadly, this dissertation hopes to make several important contributions to the discipline of political science. First, it widens the scope of civil-military relations beyond the classic problematique that has dominated the literature. Second, recognizing that patterns of citizenship are one critical component constituting the boundaries of the national political community, it illustrates the value of an institutional approach to the nation—in contrast to those works that exclusively stress either individual choice or the apolitical exercise of the imagination. Finally, it seeks to demonstrate that culturalist and rationalist mechanisms are neither mutually exclusive nor merely complementary, but are more deeply intertwined.

13,2001,"The 'American Century' Army:  The Origins of the U.S. Cold War Army, 1949-1959","This dissertation covers the period 1949-1959 and has two primary purposes.  The first is to determine the nature of the creation of the U.S. Cold War Army during the period 1949 and 1953 by examining how senior Army leaders were able to fundamentally broaden the institution’s intellectual and historical framework of “preparedness” to design a blueprint for a new type of ground force that would be more adept to meet the challenges of the new nature of war imposed by the Cold War.  This “blueprint” was conceived well before the advent of the Korean War in 1950 and actually used to design the “Cold War Army” when the Korean War broke out.  The second aim addresses the nature of the historical anomaly that followed the Korean War (1950-1953), from 1954 to 1959, where for the first time in its history, the United States did not substantially disband a war-time Army force structure in accordance with its long standing post-war demobilization tradition.

This dissertation argues that the most important explanation for the Army’s remarkable and unprecedented build-up in the 1950s was that the generals of the Cold War Army recognized, before most political leaders, that the nature of war had changed.  Perhaps the most significant factor undergirding the generals’ success, one overlooked by many historians, was that the generals of the cold war did not make the Soviet military threat the Army’s sole raison d’être.  While the Red Army remained a key focus for the Army, the leaders of the Cold War Army successfully expanded the institution’s purpose to include “furthering and protecting” U.S. national interests, which, owing to America’s responsibilities after WWII for reestablishing a world order based of national sovereignty and a free market system, was global.  In other words, the confluence of an authentic threat and global extension of America’s national interests offered two subtle, closely wedded, but entirely different frameworks by which to design a militarily defensible purpose for revitalizing a ready peacetime army.  The army generals of the early cold war years exploited this understanding.  Thus the justification for the creation of the Cold War Army arose not only because of the Soviet military threat, but also apart from it.  “Furthering and protecting” vital national interests would eventually place the Cold War Army in dozens of locations around the world where no direct threat to the nation was apparent.

By 1959, the generals achieved their purpose.  The Army that emerged after 1959 marked the beginning of the “American Century’ Army and continued as the largest, costliest, and longest- serving peacetime Army in the history of the United States.  This transformation occurred primarily because of three extraordinary Army chiefs of staff: Generals J. Lawton Collins (1949-1953); Matthew B. Ridgway (1953-1955); and Maxwell D. Taylor (1955-1959).  Under their tenures, the institution’s prestige was restored and its purpose no longer undermined by the cost-saving, but militarily bankrupt, strategy of strategic air power.  To date, no comprehensive explanation exists to satisfactorily account for this phenomenon.

12,2001,Barbarism and War,"An apparent contradiction separates the attempts of states to regulate violence in warfare in the abstract from the practice of states once engaged in actual wars.  Attempts to moderate the conduct of war have a long and rich history: the just war principle of discrimination (initially articulated in the middle ages) that requires combatants to distinguish between enemy soldiers and civilians, and abstain from intentional harm to the latter, has become increasingly codified in positive international law and encoded in international ethical norms that prescribe legal and appropriate conduct in war.  However impressive this increasing degree of legalization and institutionalization may seem, the norm against intentionally harming civilians in wartime is frequently flouted, resembling what Stephen Krasner has called “organized hypocrisy.”
This dissertation seeks to explain why this phenomenon occurs.  Why do governments seek to coerce other governments, groups, or peoples by using barbarism—military strategies designed to achieve victory in war by causing harm to enemy civilians?  What causes some wars to escalate from conventional confrontations between designated military forces to no-holds-barred slugging matches between nations in which no segment of the population is exempt from injury?
Current explanations based in organizational culture, the constitutive effect of international norms, regime type, and shared civilized identity fail to provide a positive theory of barbarism: they do not explain why states might view enemy civilians as an attractive target.  A convincing explanation must be able to explain not only why states would want to harm enemy civilians, but what determines variation in the occurrence of barbarism from war to war, and between different historical epochs.

15,2001,Working out the Inevitable:  Domestic Coalition Shifts in War Termination,"What keeps wars going and what finally makes them stop?  Historical evidence suggests that wars, once begun, are very difficult to stop.  They seem to last much longer and cost much more than belligerents expect at the outset.  The reasons why a war persists and eventually ends are more complex than a mere comparison of belligerents’ capabilities.  As Stephen Van Evera wrote, “War tends to persist, to intensify, to become unmanageable, and to get out of control.  It has an inherent tendency to outlive its purpose, and to grow to disproportionate size relative to that purpose.”   Ending war is a tough business.  States frequently find it much more difficult to get out of a war that to get into one.  Moreover, most wars last well beyond the point where rational calculation would dictate that they end.  By focusing on the reasons why wars continue, this dissertation will develop a model about the domestic coalitions that decide to prosecute and eventually end international wars.   
Interstate war duration is a continuous variable; wars range in length from a few days to many years.  At one end of the spectrum, short wars tend to fall into two categories, decisive wars and self-limiting wars.   Decisive wars, such as the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, end because of a severe inequality in the belligerents’ capabilities.  These wars are one-sided triumphs, and the “loser” is left with no option but to settle.  Self-limiting wars, such as the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, end when the more powerful side unilaterally stops fighting.  These wars are usually started because the powerful side wants to improve its bargaining position or teach its opponent a lesson.  In effect, these wars are examples of coercion in the course of diplomacy.  In both categories, the war ends when the more powerful actor wants it to end.
At the other end of the spectrum, long wars tend to be characterized by “sticky” policies.  Here decision makers find it more difficult – for a variety of reasons discussed below – to shift policies and strategies related to prosecuting and ending the war as quickly as the rational choice approach would suggest.  In these wars, war does not necessarily end when the decision maker wants it to.  Rather, the longer the war goes on, the more the dynamics of “sticky” policies kick in.  This creates a positive feedback loop and further lengthens the war.  I argue that “sticky” wars can only end once both belligerents have a change in their expectations about the war.  This change in expectations occurs most often with a shift in the governing coalition.  In cases of clear battlefield success, we should expect a coalition shift on the “losing” side to be sufficient.  In cases of ambiguous battlefield performance or stalemate, we should expect to see a shift in the governing coalitions of both sides.
Why does a coalition shift have to occur for the war to end?  First, if the war was not “won,” there will be scapegoating, and a coalition shift would allow the scapegoat to be identified and removed.  Second, as Fred Iklé has noted, the coalition shift could occur for the practical procedural reason that leadership needs to toss out those who are against making peace.  Third, the coalition shift could provide the previous leaders a “golden parachute” so that they will not be harmed after the settlement.  Fourth, the coalition shift could be necessary for stabilizing the domestic political scene after the settlement; in other words, to make the peace, the leaders must include the loyal opposition.
I argue that a coalition shift can occur because of two causal mechanisms – information or entrapment.  The shift occurs because either the rational updating process does not occur equally among all coalition members, or some coalition members face entrapment.  On the one hand, the rational updating process does not occur equally among all coalition members, because they (1) do not necessarily share the same information about the war; (2) use different dominant indicators to assess the war; or (3) have personal cognitive or organizational biases that prevent them from using all information available about the war.  On the other hand, some decision makers will want to settle the war but cannot because they face political entrapment by their domestic constituency or their external allies.  
The dissertation is divided into three parts and a conclusion.  In Part I, chapter 1 outlines theoretical considerations from the existing war termination literature and develops my theory.  Chapter 2 tests this theory on the interstate wars since World War II in a statistical-correlative analysis.  Part II is a detailed qualitative examination of the mechanisms that caused coalition shifts in the long and stalemated Korean War.  Chapter 3 examines US decision-making in the war, while chapter 4 examines Communist decision-making.  Finally, Part III traces my argument in the short and stalemated Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.  Chapter 5 examines the Indian case, while chapter 6 examines the Pakistani case.

10,2001,The 1947 Partition of South Asia and Its  Lessons for Modern Peacemaking,"Continuing conflict in previously partitioned regions, including the Middle East, the Balkans, Ireland, South Asia, and the Korean peninsula, indicates that past models of partition are problematic at best.  Because policy makers are still considering partition as a tool to end conflict, as demonstrated by the 1995 division of the former Yugoslavia and by recent Israeli proposals for a “unilateral separation” in the Middle East, there is a pressing need for accurate information on the process of partition.  My analysis of the 1947 partition of South Asia, based on archival research, interviews, and other previously unreleased material from Britain, Pakistan, and India, not only sheds light on current tension in the Indian subcontinent, but also identifies practical steps necessary to implement workable partitions in other troubled regions.
Drawing on material never before examined by scholars, my work identifies specific ways in which the 1947 division was flawed.  The primary error of partition, for which all parties must share responsibility, was misguided reliance on a best-case result, combined with consistent refusal even to prepare for a worst-case post-partition scenario.  In addition, the architects of partition neglected to incorporate these crucial factors:
1) a sufficiently prolonged timetable to allow for necessary geographic surveys and other information gathering, boundary delineation, public announcement of the new line, and, if necessary, transfer of populations;
2) completion of territorial partition before final political separation;
3) exhaustive definition of cooperative procedures for resource sharing or, failing        that, clear and complete division of linked infrastructure systems.
Future partitions must include these elements in order to avoid the failures that so tragically limited the effectiveness of the South Asian partition.  The daunting nature of this task, particularly the intricate problem of linked infrastructures, makes it clear that partition must be a last resort.
This project challenges the notion that partition can be appraised in absolute terms, as either limiting or exacerbating violence.  In reality, it often does both; one of the paradoxes of the 1947 partition is that it stimulated new violence even as it resolved political conflict on some levels.  This project will contribute to a more nuanced and practical understanding of the ways that partition can contribute to containing violence, the steps required to make partition effective, and the limits of this particular tool for peace.

9,2001,The History of the 2nd  Canadian Division,"During the First World War, the Canadian Corps played a major part in Allied military operations on the Western Front.  For example, in the period between August 8 and October 11, 1918, the four divisions of the Canadian Corps engaged and defeated no less than forty-seven German divisions.  This amounted to almost a quarter of the total German forces on the Western Front.  How did a corps composed overwhelmingly of civilian volunteers achieve such a high level of military effectiveness between 1914 and 1918?
In order to answer this question, this dissertation will analyze the social dynamics and operational record of a case study formation, the 2nd Canadian Division, which contained roughly 20,000 men.  An army’s operational efficiency cannot be comprehended fully without understanding the interplay of its structural articulation, command and control arrangements, and internal relations.  A divisional study permits a more focused examination of social conditions and organizational issues than could be gained from a survey of the entire Canadian Corps. It simultaneously provides a broader focus than would be obtained from a narrower study of one of the division’s component units. The 2nd Division was chosen for this study because it contained a more complete regional cross-section of Canadians than did the other Canadian divisions.  
A database drawn from the personnel files of a randomized sample of 360 individual soldiers has been assembled in order to explore the social dynamics of the 2nd Division.  The analysis of medical, disciplinary, and training records of individual servicemen will reveal how they managed to cope with the changing nature of the war in physical, psychological, and military terms. The organizational structure of the 2nd Division, the execution of military operations, and the relations among officers and other ranks have been examined through various archival collections of official and private papers in both Canada and the United Kingdom.  Contemporary management theory has also provided insight into the beneficial nature of the participative leadership styles exhibited by many officers in the 2nd Division and the rest of the Canadian Corps.  By examining a wide variety of sources and employing theories and techniques from military and social history, social psychology, and management studies, this dissertation will place the achievements of the Canadian Corps in clearer context, thus providing a more effective means of comparing the experiences of Canadian troops during the First World War with those of allied and opposing forces.

11,2001,The  Internationalization of Self-Determination Claims,"Self-determination cases occupy a prominent place on the international agenda, presenting both a perplexing legal issue and a daunting policy problem as numerous groups invoke a legal right to self-determination in a quest for more political freedom, autonomy or even independence from the central government.  But despite the number and intensity of conflicts in which such claims are advanced, we have few theoretical explanations for understanding self-determination in the post- Cold War era.  In particular, how does such an ostensibly domestic issue become internationalized: when does the international community recognize a group’s self-determination claim as legitimate and worthy of international engagement?   In my dissertation, I posit that international actors draw upon values embedded in the international system, using ideas about legitimate governance—ideas that citizens should have a voice in government and enjoy broad political rights—as a framework within which to assess self-determination claims.  Specifically, groups more likely to be successful in evincing international recognition for their claim and involvement from inter-governmental organizations (IGOs) are those which (a) are participatory/democratic in their domestic structure and (b) are oppressed or denied political participation by the central government.
Through a combination of comparative analysis across a broad selection of cases (descriptive statistics) and detailed case studies (including process tracing and field interviews), this dissertation shows how international norms are internalized by sub-state actors and utilized in their appeals to international audiences, eliciting a response within the posited normative framework.  The success of these efforts is enhanced by the presence of complementary domestic norms and conditions, highlighting the interaction of international and domestic norms.  The cases also describe how norms interact with material factors to influence actors’ interests and strategic action.  Further, once an IGO is involved in a self-determination case, it will pressure the central government to end oppression and discrimination against the minority and will place conditions on the self-determination movement (to respect minority rights, desist using terror tactics, and engage in existing democratic institutions) in exchange for international support.  The international community thus responds to sub-state actors and domestic conditions within a normative framework that shapes political action and encourages successful resolution of self-determination conflicts.

I arrived at this decision in part because of practical considerations—the fact that less than three hundred officers served at four-star rank during the thirty-year period under study certainly facilitates research in greater depth—but also because four-star officers combination of unparalleled authority, long service, and status as the ultimate products of a rigorous career-long process of selection make them a uniquely influential and significant group within the officer corps—the highest-ranking members of the group identified by sociologist Morris Janowitz as “the military elite,” possessing “the greatest amount of actual and potential power;” and inclined to “use their skills to achieve social and political ends. . . ,” as opposed to lower-ranking officers ""content to practice their profession for personal and immediate rewards.""1  ",Military History,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24,2002,"The Development of Turbojet Aircraft in Britain, Germany and the United States: A Multi-National Comparison of Aeronautical Engineering","In my Dissertation, I am going to incorporate an analysis of the three World War Two jet programs in comparison.  The Germans were the first to press jet aircraft into combat, but the British and Americans were also able to design, build, and fly (and in the British case put into operations) jet aircraft before the end of the war.  Thus, my project falls under a variety of subject headings: science and technology, comparative studies, military history, business history, cultural history, etc… I will attempt to address each of these issues for your clarification.  
        
        The short (interview type) explanatory statement of my project is “my dissertation deals with the analysis of the cultural context of engineering during the temporal period 1930-1950.  Specifically, I look at the development of aeronautical engineering with the innovation of turbojet aircraft as my case study.”  The sample set is three; Germany, Britain, and the US.  I chose jet aircraft for a few reasons: the history of aviation development is recent and exciting, the impact of engineering cannot be underestimated, and accelerated evolution during wartime provides an excellent case study complete with wonderful (and fairly complete) documentation.  And, although the topic is marginally military, I attempt to tie it into the greater context of national engineering theory and practice and relate jet aircraft to not only necessity, but also predisposition.

        In the course of my research I have come across a number of interesting items.  In the German records (and as part of my developing thesis), the Germans needed the jet plane to try to combat Allied air superiority towards the end of the war.  The Germans tended to over-engineer military hardware (and civilian as well), and in this case study I analyze the actual engineering involved in the jet program, and how the Germans “got it right.”  Before the war the Germans had embarked on a double agenda: the military (and Hitler) wanted rearmament with the best engineering the Germans could produce, and aircraft manufacturing sought speed actively.  These agendas, combined with superior German engineering education and facilities developed the best aeronautical engineers and engine designers in the pre-war period.  The Germans flew the first jet aircraft before the war, and developed the jet plane for combat operations during hostilities, in the midst of material and manpower shortages.  In my dissertation I also address the point that the Germans switch from a centrifugal-flow compressor to an axial-flow type, but this can wait for our conversation as I do not want to overburden non-engineer types with decidedly technical discussion.  Suffice it to say that the Germans pursued (and attained) the best and most efficient designs from the outset to have a viable combat jet aircraft as soon as was possible.  There were multiple delays, but none were more influential than the problems directly related to the development of the Jumo 004 engines.

        The Brits on the other hand did not put government funding into the program until well after the Battle of Britain.  Frank Whittle had an excellent idea, and eventually a working engine, but the Air Ministry was not initially interested.  This I attribute to a number of factors: initial anti-militarism, budget problems, and a lack of need for a high-speed high-altitude aircraft.  But eventually, the Air Ministry gave in and funded development of the jet aircraft in Britain.  Gloster was given the airframe contract, and Whittle assisted by the Rolls-Royce Company – after major problems with Rover – developed the British turbojet engine.  The Gloster Meteor flew and was operational by the end of the war, but its performance was markedly lacking with regards to the German jets; the Meteor was relegated to Home Defense.

        The Americans literally copied the British jet engine program.  Through Lend-Lease, General of the Air Forces (‘Hap’ Arnold) acquired blueprints for the British jet (Whittle W.2b) as well as an original Whittle design (W.1x), which was sent to General Electric for copy and manufacture (March 1941).  GE was chosen because they were the American (and even world) leaders in turbo-supercharger development; engineering, materials, and concepts similar to early centrifugal-flow turbojet engines.  Bell Aircraft was chosen to build the first American jet airframe because Larry Bell and his company were known for radical aircraft designs (P-39, P-63, YFM-1), were very close to GE’s New York plant, and were not overly busy producing for the war!  The Americans entered the jet age third, on October 1, 1942.  The XP-59a Airacomet (later P-59a) was the American attempt to prove the viability of jet aircraft.  But, the P-59a was also a disappointment; performance was not even as good as the contemporary North American P-51 Mustang.  The P-59a was relegated to training as Lockheed was awarded the contract to improve the airframe while GE upgraded the engine.

        The point to the Allied jet programs was that the Allies did not need jet aircraft.  The Americans were contented on a number of levels to manufacture good planes (bombers and fighters) in massive numbers to overcome the Axis with quantity over quality.  The Axis needed quality because they could not overcome Allied industrial capacity.  In the end, the Germans develop jets because of a need, the Allies both realize fundamentally that the jet would be a post-war R&D project.

        In the context of international securities studies (and this conference), the importance of the jet aircraft, as well as turbojet technology, comes at the end of the war.  Just as with rocket, atomic, sigint, etc. technology, there was a scramble at the end of the war to gather up all the best Axis material and manpower to bolster victorious military R&D programs.  In different amounts, each of the victorious Allies implemented German technology after the war into their respective military hardware developmental programs.  The Cold War was shaped (in my mind and dissertation) by the science and technology developed during the war and captured afterwards.  In the international situation, the Germans provided substantial advances to technological development in the immediate post-war period.

21,2002,"The Early Vietnam War: A Sino-Soviet-Vietnamese Perspective, 1964-1966","  The historiography on the 2nd Vietnam War has focused mostly on the American side, while the ‘other side,’ especially for the early Vietnam War, 1964-1966, has not attracted much attention.   Based on extensive research of documents declassified in Russian, East German, Polish, and Hungarian archives over the last ten years, and on a careful reading of recently published Chinese documents and memoirs, this paper tries to reconstruct the largely unknown Sino-Soviet-Vietnamese perspective of the early Vietnam War, and to analyze the choices the three countries took with regard to the war effort and with regard to their mutual relations.
  During the 2nd Vietnam War, cooperation within the ‘socialist camp’ to assist North Vietnam militarily and economically was weak.  The lack of any multinational mechanism to coordinate aid to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) hampered the North Vietnamese war effort substantially.  Why was the ‘socialist camp’ unable to cooperate when it faced one of the most serious (American) challenges in the Cold War?  Without elucidating the development of relations within the ‘socialist camp’ in the background of the war, it is impossible to understand the chain of almost bizarre events that prevented any cooperation.  The Sino-Soviet alliance – the bedrock of communist East Asia – by the early 1960s had become a victim of increasingly divisive Chinese domestic politics.  Mao Zedong for internal reasons needed external conflict.  As a result, the early 2nd Vietnam War not only fell victim to the progressively hostile relations among the two communist giants, but also acted as the catalyst for the ultimate collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance.

23,2002,Making a World of Nations: The Wilsonian Moment and the Origins of the Postcolonial World,"As the Paris Peace Conference convened in early 1919, representatives from all corners of the world gathered, invited or otherwise, to advocate for their peoples. Inspired in their expectations and actions by the bold ideals championed by the president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, they adopted Wilsonian language in formulating and justifying nationalist goals, and often sought American support in attaining them. Bitter disappointment followed when the results of the Peace Conference fell far short of such expectations, but the pursuit of self-determination, a goal articulated and committed to at the “Wilsonian Moment,” continued unabated. Thus, the advent of Wilsonianism, whose impact is often contextualized within the evolution of twentieth century American foreign policy, had consequences that far exceed the boundaries of American history, or American historical memory.

To the extent that non-Western regions and peoples, with the exception of Japan, figure at all in the current narratives on the Paris Peace Conference, it is as inert masses of territory and humanity, spoils divided among the victorious powers. Using multi-archival research in four languages, including Arabic and Chinese, this study focuses on four selected case studies—China, India, Egypt and Korea—to bring back into the story these submerged voices. It shows how the global diffusion of a novel discourse of international legitimacy at the “Wilsonian Moment” had a crucial role in shaping nationalist movements outside the West, and, ultimately, the dynamics of postcolonial international relations

19,2002,"AMERICAN INFANTRYMEN IN THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE, THE CIVIL WAR, AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR","If institutional settings and political systems affect domestic policy choices why then should they not also effect foreign policy decisions in a similar fashion?  While this question applies to countries and all regime types this research focuses on one part of the larger question.  My research examines institutional variation among democratic states and its effect on the use of force in the international system.  I consider how differences in institutional arrangements influence a government’s decision to use force against another state.  I argue that variation in institutional structures creates different incentives across democracies that effect decisions to initiate, escalate, respond to threats and terminate disputes.  Furthermore, I argue that it is not any single institutional feature that affects the decision process; rather it is the political outcomes of the overall variation in institutional design that is responsible for policy choices.  Institutional structures such as district magnitude, presidential versus parliamentary systems, fixed elections versus constitutional inter-election periods, etc. do not individually affect decision-making.  It is the combination of these institutions and the political system that emerges out of this institutional framework that affects the overall decision-making process.  This dissertation focuses on these outcomes, how they vary between countries and within counties over time, and how they affect foreign policy making in parliamentary systems
Moreover, this research bridges the gap between comparative politics and international relations.  Peceny, Beer and Sanchez-Terry note, “Scholars have increasingly recognized the artificiality of the disciplinary division between the study of comparative politics and that of international relations.  Domestic politics inevitably affects the foreign policies of states” (2002:15).  The argument in this dissertation builds on recent literatures from both subfields.  One literature that has emerged in international relations focuses on the relationship of leadership survivability to conflict outcomes.  I build from the simple premise developed in this literature: losing a war is bad for the tenure of executives and governments.  (Bueno de Mesquita, Siverson and Wollers 1992; Bueno do Mesquita and Siverson 1995, Goemens 2000, Grieco and Gelpi 2002).  The second and related literature, which comes from comparative politics, is the government survival literature (Browne and Frendreis 1980; Dodd 1976; Laver and Shepsle 1997, Warwick 1992, 1994).  This literature focuses on the factors that make parliamentary governments more or less stable over time.  What the two literatures share is a focus on the costs associated with, and the probability of, executive and government failure.  
The leadership survival literature argues policy choice is determined by the probability of success of the policy and the likelihood of removal given the outcome.  Yet what determines the probability of removal?  The government survival literature answers this question.  Specifically, I develop a model of policy choice based on the probability of the executive or in this case the government, losing office focusing on the opportunity and transaction costs that parties face when considering changing governments in parliamentary systems.  Furthermore I argue that foreign polices have the potential to change the costs of removal and that governments are aware of this when deciding to enter into, escalate, or terminate a dispute.   
This dissertation also applies the same theoretical framework to different aspects of conflict decision-making.  Often theories are used to explain either the onset, or escalation of conflict.  In addition to unpacking democracy I also disaggregate disputes into their constituent parts to better explain the dispute process as a whole.  I use a number of methodological tools including hazard analysis and discrete variable regression.  I test my hypotheses on 18 states that have parliamentary governments between the years 1945-1992.  I use both the MID data set as well as the SHERFACS data.  
The talk that I plan to give focuses on the theoretical framework I have developed and applies it to the question of escalation and audience costs.  Do all democracies generate the same audience costs or do different institutional settings allow certain democratic leaders to generate higher audience costs thus being better able to signal credible threats?  One drawback of recent research in this area has been the focus on only disputes that escalate.  However, if certain governments can generate higher audience costs then we should actually see fewer militarized disputes or incidences of escalation.  By using a different data set than the Militarized Interstate Dispute dataset, I examine both instances of escalation and when disputes settle short of escalation.

18,2002,"Pride, Prejudice, and Plutonium: Explaining Decisions to Acquire Nuclear Weapons","Why, when, and how do state leaders decide to acquire nuclear weapons?  Although the underlying capacities necessary to build nuclear weapons are ubiquitous, fewer than 10 states actually have the bomb.  I argue that the decision to go nuclear is a revolutionary decision that requires an extraordinary degree of motivation and certitude.  This psychological state in the individual decision maker results from the combination of an existential fear of an external outgroup and a staunch ingroup pride.  Leaders holding ""oppositional nationalist"" sentiments have a unique predisposition to experience this explosive psychological cocktail.  Oppositional nationalism combines ""opposition""—a depiction of the nation as endangered by an Other that is deeply menacing to its core interests and values—with ""nationalism""—a depiction of the nation as capable of finding the means and the will that will allow it to face the Other down.
I test my theory against the nuclear histories of four very different countries: Argentina, Australia, France, and India.  The first two did not go nuclear, while the second two did.  In each case I use rigorous analysis on original data to explain the why, when, and how of their decisions on the bomb, as well as of their decisions on related issues such as whether to build up nuclear technology, to seek nuclear security guarantees, and to sign international nuclear arms control agreements.
         The overall approach introduced here has wide potential applicability.  The fundamental novelty of this approach is to emphasize the role of emotions as conduits for the expression of deeply held understandings of the nation's purposes and potential in the international arena.  It marries a flesh-and-blood model of human decisionmaking with a social-scientific approach to issues of measurement and theory-testing.

16,2002,Long March to Peace: China and the Settlement of Territorial Disputes,"Based on its imperial history and military power, China today ought to be a state that resolves its territorial disputes through coercion or the occupation of contested territory.China has, in fact, participated in a large number of disputes, but surprisingly it has settled the majority of them by signing compromise agreements that divide contested territory. Of China's 23 disputes, six were settled in the 1960s and another twelve were defused or resolved in the 1990s. My dissertation explains this puzzle: why a strong state with historical grievances and potential irredentist claims might peacefully settle its territorial disputes.
I argue that China's behavior is best explained as a response to real or perceived windows of vulnerability with respect to territorial integrity. When faced with an internal challenge to territorial integrity, such as a rebellion or revolt, Chinese leaders are much more likely to settle outstanding disputes through compromise agreements. By improving relations with its neighbors, Chinese leaders seek to close these windows and focus efforts on establishing or restoring domestic order. When faced with an external challenge to territorial integrity, China is more likely to consider the use of force, especially during periods of perceived internal weakness or when such pressure is linked directly to vulnerable borderland regions. 
To make this argument, I develop an informal model of territorial dispute settlement. I begin with the assumption that leaders have strong incentives not to settle territorial disputes, lest they suffer punishment at home. Any explanation of dispute settlement must then explain how these incentives change, giving leaders a reason to pursue otherwise costly compromise agreements. This model demonstrates that leaders will seek to settle territorial disputes based upon a change in the opportunity costs for participating in territorial disputes, usually poor relations with neighboring states or diverted resources. Importantly, a range of domestic and international factors can produce dramatic shifts in these opportunity costs. 
 The demographic characteristics of China' s border regions are a key driver of China' s opportunity costs. In non-ethnic Chinese minority areas, many of which lie along its international borders, China is much ~ likely to settle territorial disputes in response to internal challenges to territorial integrity, such as rebellion or revolt. China' s two waves of dispute settlements stem from the Tibetan revolt and Xinjiang migration in the early 1960s and widespread ethnic unrest in the 1990s, respectively. External pressure on these non-Chinese minority areas, especially during periods of unrest, greatly increase the likelihood that China will use force in support of its claims to maintain territorial integrity.
 By contrast, China is much ~ likely to seek compromise settlements over Chinese areas. Given the importance of Ran Chinese areas in modern CCP nationalism, there is no set of opportunity costs that would lead China' s leaders to pursue a compromise settlement of these disputes. Rather, China's leaders would prefer to delay settlement until the other side was willing to agree to its terms. China is also more likely to use force in such disputes in response to a much lower level of external pressure on ethnic Chinese areas, namely when it perceives a trend towards growing autonomy or independence. Likewise, China is much ~ likely to pursue compromise settlements over unpopulated offshore islands. Distant from the continental mainland and without any native population, these features are not central to the territorial integrity of the Chinese state nor are they costly for China's leaders to dispute. Thus there are few incentives to settle these disputes.

20,2002,How Refugee Crises Lead to the Spread of Civil War,"sending state pursues the refugees, subjecting them to military attack. In other cases, militant exiles use the refugee camps as rear bases in their attacks on the sending state. As the cross-border attacks escalate, the risk of international war grows. Since the early 1990s, refugee crises in Central Africa, West Africa, the Balkans, and Indonesia have led to the international spread of internal conflict.
The recurring pattern of violent refugee crises, prompts the following three questions: 1) How widespread is the phenomenon of political violence involving refugees? 2) Under what conditions do refugee crises cause a civil war to spread across borders? 3) What role can international actors, such as the United Nations or the United States government, play in preventing the spread of violence? To answer the above questions, this project presents new time series data on refugee-related political violence and also systematically compares violent and non-violent crises involving Rwandan, Bosnian, and Afghan refugees.
This project advances a political explanation for the spread of civil war in refugee crises and tests it against the prevailing socioeconomic explanation. According to the political explanation, three factors combine to cause the spread of civil war. 1) Strong political cohesion among the group before exile determines initial refugee militancy. 2) A refugee hosting state that lacks the capability and/or willingness to secure borders and demilitarize refugees facilitates the spread of war. 3) Third party states and non-state actors that intentionally or inadvertently contribute resources to combatants expand the conflict.

26,2003,"The War’s Not Over Until the Last Man Comes Home!’:
Body Recovery And The Vietnam War
","After the Vietnam War, the United States undertook what Senator John Kerry has characterized as “the most expensive, most thorough, most effective, most extraordinary and comprehensive effort to provide for the accounting of the missing in the history of human warfare.”  That effort focused on recovering American remains from Southeast Asia.  This dissertation examines the origins and influence of the unprecedented effort to recover American remains from Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War through an historical analysis of political culture.  

Ostensibly pursued as part of a long military tradition meant to provide “closure” to the families of the missing, post-Vietnam body recovery was markedly different from any such effort that came before it, and inspired controversy more than closure.  I argue that body recovery was perpetuated after the Vietnam War due to the inability of state and military authorities to control the process as they had in the past.  While state elites sought to use body recovery to reconstruct popular nationalism and political obligation in the wake of the war, MIA activists seized on its limitations as evidence of the ongoing betrayal of Vietnam-era servicemen.  Though the POW/MIA movement is often perceived as right-wing, even militaristic, its insistence upon “the fullest possible accounting” for missing Americans represented a fundamental challenge to the citizen’s obligation to sacrifice for the state that re-shaped patriotic culture and placed strict constraints on military action in the post-Vietnam era.

28,2003,Pathogens as Weapons: The International Security Implications of Biological Warfare,"In contrast to the nuclear revolution, the security implications of biological weapons and the biotechnology revolution have not been subject to the same degree of rigorous analysis. This dissertation draws upon a range of theories from the field of security studies including offense-defense theory, deterrence theory, the security dilemma, and opaque proliferation theory to analyze the strategic consequences of the proliferation of biological weapons to states and non-state actors. The dissertation argues that since biological warfare strongly favors the attacker, the dual-use nature of biotechnology makes it is difficult to distinguish between offensive and defensive or civilian activities, and these weapons undermine deterrence, it will be extremely difficult to prevent the proliferation of these weapons to dissatisfied actors seeking a means of challenging the status quo. In addition, the intense secrecy shrouding biological weapons programs will lead to suspicion abroad and flawed decision-making at home. Contrary to convention wisdom, I find that biological weapons are not equivalent to the “poor man’s atomic bomb” and are not well suited to fulfilling the strategic deterrent role performed by nuclear weapons. In addition, the accessibility of these weapons and their suitability for conducting anonymous attacks undermines deterrence by raising the prospect of acquisition by non-deterrable actors such as terrorist groups and reducing the credibility of retaliatory threats by complicating the ability of states to identify the perpetrator of an attack. As the proliferation and sophistication of biological weapons grows, the strength of these destabilizing influences on international security will only increase.",Unconventional Warfare / Conflcit Between States,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36,2004,Dual Containment and European Integration. ,"This dissertation seeks to answer a simple question: why have the states of Western Europe integrated their economies since 1945? In the process of answering this question, Mr. Rosato answers several others. Why have they failed to integrate their militaries? Why has integration not occurred elsewhere or at other times? And what are the prospects for a ‘United States of Europe'? The central argument of this work is that economic integration in a given region of the world is structurally determined. What matters most in this story is the distribution of power among the major states both within the region and globally. Economic integration occurs if two specific conditions hold. First, the region in question must be unipolar, that is, it must contain only one great power, and it must also contain a potential great power. Second, the international system as a whole must be bipolar. The logic behind this claim is straightforward: the presence of a single great power and a potential great power in a region engenders a dual containment problem, economic integration offers a solution to that problem, and global bipolarity provides the conditions under which integration can be successfully carried out. Each of these three conditions was met in postwar Europe. Mr. Rosato tests the plausibility of his argument by comparing Europe after 1945 to Europe before 1945, as well comparing Europe after 1945 to Asia and North America after 1945. In addition, he process traces all the major events in integration history to establish whether events in Europe unfolded as his theory predicts.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39,2004,The Benefits of Escalated and Enduring Territorial Disputes: Why Settlement is Not Always the Best Strategy,"The most enduring territorial disputes and those that are most likely to escalate to tense situations, which could involve threat or use of force, are those over territory with only nationalist value - historic links to the land or ethnic ties, regardless of whether the territory has economic value. It is puzzling why rational decision makers often persist 
in disputes when settlement could provide significant economic benefits to both states or why settlement over territory with no economic value is so difficult to achieve. To explain why disputes with nationalist value alone or together with economic value are most enduring and most likely to escalate, Ms. Wiegand proposes three factors that influence decision makers in their choice of strategies. Ms. Wiegand proposes three factors that influence decision makers in their choice of strategies. These factors, level of domestic support, level of reputation for resolve in bargaining, and level of interdependence, could provide decision makers and states with non-territorial payoffs that provide incentives to persevere, attempt settlement, or escalate. She hypothesizes that decision makers with vulnerable domestic support and states with weak bargaining positions and weak interdependent relationships are least likely to attempt settlement and more likely to escalate. To test the theory, she uses quantitative and qualitative analysis of four territorial disputes: 1) Falkland/Malvinas islands (Argentina-United Kingdom), 2) Senkaku/Diaoyu islands (China-Japan), 3) Hawar islands (Qatar-Bahrain), and 4) Belize (Guatemala-Belize). Findings from all four disputes show that the above-mentioned factors do play a significant role in the strategies of decision makers in territorial disputes

38,2004,The Utility of Force: War Aims and Asymmetric War Outcomes,"Despite their immense war-fighting capacity, major power states failed to attain their primary political objective in almost 40% of their military operations against weak state and non-state targets since 1945. Why do strong states frequently fail to achieve even limited objectives when they use military force against vastly weaker targets? Evidence from recent research suggests that war outcomes are largely a function of strategic selection (war initiation), military-industrial capabilities, combat effectiveness, and strategy choice. But none of these factors can explain why a major power would ever lose an armed conflict with a weak target. In sharp contrast to existing theories, Ms. Sullivan focuses on the political objectives of a military operation to explain asymmetric war outcomes. She argues that relative military capabilities and relative tolerance for the costs of war affect the outcome of all wars, but that in asymmetric wars, the marginal effect of these two factors varies according to the nature of the political objective being pursued by the strong state. By acknowledging the critical role of war aims, this theory is able to 1) identify constraints on the military effectiveness of strong states and 2) specify the conditions under which military capabilities determine outcomes and those under which relative tolerance for costs moderates the effectiveness of force. The empirical implications of the theory are tested on an original data set of all major power military operations against both state and nonstate targets since World War II.

35,2004,"Minds, then Hearts:” U.S. Psychological Warfare During the Korean War","Minds, then Hearts examines the resistance on the part of the U.S. military (principally the Army) towards psychological warfare and examines how this affected the weapon's use during the Korean War. In particular, the dissertation examines how the inability to demonstrate conclusively the effects of psychological warfare operations added to uncertainty and skepticism over the weapon's potential and actual impact on the battlefield. Additionally, the study explores how operational deficiencies, such as a lack of resources and poor integration with combat arms, created obstacles hampering the successful employment of psychological warfare against Chinese and North Korean forces. The study also compares the Army's efforts to use the weapon with those of the Air Force. It considers how Chinese and Russian atrocity propaganda affected the views of the U.S. military concerning their own psychological warfare campaigns. Finally, this study addresses whether or not psychological warfare made a difference on the battlefield. Mr. Jacobson's work fills an important gap. Despite the fact that the Cold War era was at its heart a “war of ideas” and propaganda played a great role on the “hot” battlefields of the time, there are, to date, no comprehensive studies of psychological warfare during the Korean War.

37,2004,When Do Brokers Have to Be Honest? Impartiality and the Effectiveness of Third-Party Intervention in Violent Conflict,"Among students of conflict management, a long-standing point of contention concerns the role of impartiality in shaping intervention outcomes. Existing research has yielded inconclusive results, with some studies showing interveners more likely to succeed if they adopt the role of an “honest broker,” others indicating exactly the opposite, and yet others suggesting that it does not matter much at all whether interveners are impartial or biased. In his dissertation, Mr. Schmidt seeks to reconcile these contradictory findings by showing that there is no simple, uniform answer to the question of how impartiality relates to intervention success. Drawing on insights from rational choice theories of crisis bargaining and war, he argues that the relationship between impartiality and intervention outcomes is an inherently contingent one that varies depending on the nature of the bargaining problem(s) confronting disputants as well as the conflict management strategy employed by the intervener. Game-theoretic modeling is used to explore the implications of this argument and identify the specific conditions under which impartiality enhances or reduces the efficacy of peacemaking efforts. The empirical part of the dissertation tests the resulting hypotheses against historical cases of intervention in both interstate and civil conflicts using a combination of statistical and case study methodology.",ConflictBetween states,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
32,2004,"SOVIET PACIFICATION POLICY IN THE WESTERN BORDERLANDS, 1939-50","My dissertation investigates the Soviet response to guerrilla warfare in the regions incorporated after the Nazi-Soviet pact: Western Ukraine, Western Belorussia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It is based on primary research in three Russian, two Ukrainian and one Canadian archive. It focusses on the nature of this conflict, the Soviet pacification strategy and the means employed against the insurgencies. Its major goal is to illuminate the peculiarities of the Soviet pacification experience in the global context, and explain the causes for the successes and failures of the Soviet approach. It addresses the following issues: the response of a multiethnic totalitarian state to nationalist challenge; the strategy of the Soviet security agencies and the problems they faced in implementing their policy at lower levels; the attitude of the civilian population caught in crossfire between the state and guerrillas; and the lessons of the Soviet experience. The dissertation shows how a quasi-Marxist ideology affected the Soviet counterinsurgency doctrine, examines the alternatives the regime had within its ideological framework and explains its choice of pacification means. It demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, Soviet pacification was based not on force alone but blended coercion with social reforms relying largely on winning the majority of the local population over to the government’s cause. In particular, I show how the Soviets used the agrarian reform to split rural society and turned counterinsurgency from a political confrontation between the state and the local population into a social conflict that brought them many more allies than enemies. I argue that Soviet pacification was mostly rational but it was undermined by other policies unrelated to it, such as collectivization, imprecise identification of the enemy prompted by Stalinist dogma, and unauthorized violence by low-level executives that made pacification much more violent that the government intended.",Conflict Between states,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33,2004,"Militarizing the Western World: Navalism, Empire, and State Building in Germany and the United States Before World War I.","This dissertation is a study of German and American navalism at the beginning of the twentieth century. Focusing on naval officers and institutions, the study explores how navalism defined the place of military force and the naval profession in state, civil society, and foreign relations. The analysis focuses on three issues — imperial policy, maritime warfare, and state building — and probes the underlying premises and practices of naval professionalism. The central contention of Militarizing the Western World is that navalism in Germany and the United States was part and parcel of a transnational militarism. Experts stressed the need to master naval warfare in a scientific and managerial manner. They participated in an increasing bureaucratic domination of society for the purposes of international competition. Dr. Bönker's study challenges both scholarly and popular understandings of Western militarization before 1918. Previous studies have stressed the unique nature of Prussian-German militarism and emphasized its role in causing the Great War. These works have also contrasted Prussian-German militarism with West European and American liberal democracies and political modernity. In fact, however, Germans and Americans pursued a common naval project. By paying attention to the transatlantic crossings and borrowing, Dr. Bönker contributes to the developing field of transnational history. ",Military History,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Conflict and Peace between Former Belligerents
",I investigate post-war relations in order to understand why and when some pairs of former belligerent states are able to reach higher levels of peace while other pairs leave one war to prepare for another war or languish in low levels of peace. I start by introducing the current empirical approaches to recurrent conflict and I maintain that we need to reconsider our conceptualization of peace and move away from thinking of peace as being the absence of conflict. I argue that we need to integrate into our analysis of warfare the various levels of peace that these countries attain and to study to a much greater extent the determinants of various levels of peace. I suggest a number of hypotheses developed from existing literature and test these hypotheses relying upon statistical estimation techniques. The findings indicate that many factors influence the chances of another war and attaining higher levels of peace but that these elements need to be considered within the context of the dyad’s level of peace.,IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
29,2004,International conflict and Cooperation: The Interaction of Power and Interests,"Realism, constructivism, and some strains of liberalism tell us that power and interest are two of the most important concepts in the study of interstate conflict and cooperation. Despite this attention the theoretical literature is unclear about the proper relationship between power and interest, and their relationship to conflict and cooperation. Focusing at the dyadic level, I argue the meanings of power and interest are intertwined. The effects of both variables are conditional on the other. Understanding this conditional relationship sheds new light on common understandings of the security dilemma in international politics. I test my theory with statistical models on the incidence, timing, and severity of interstate disputes and on alliance formation and duration. The results of these statistical models support the argument that there is a meaningful interaction between power and interests and contradict much of the current literature on the relationship between power and interstate conflict and cooperation. I elucidate the causal mechanisms of the theory, and show directly how it relates to the security dilemma, with a case study of the end of the Cold War.",IR Scholarship,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
40,2005,When Good Fences Make Good Neighbors; And When They Make Bad Ones: the International Effects of ‘Border Fixity’,"Since the end of the Second World War, an international norm of “border fixity”— a proscription on the use of force to alter interstate boundaries — has become prevalent in world politics. As a consequence, very few cases of conquest and annexation of homeland territory occurred since 1945. The dissertation asks what are the effects of the norm of border fixity on interstate conflict and peace? 
The dissertation advances the argument that the effects of border fixity would diverge according to the states’ institutional strength — that is, the degree to which it possessed effective governmental institutions and enjoyed high level of legitimacy as a state — at the historical moment of the normative shift. In regions where states are institutionally strong, border fixity is likely to result in a positive shift to a more peaceful and stable international environment, because  (a) wars of territorial conquest are no longer a legitimate option to states; (b) states that are confident about the preservation of their borders are less likely to think in “zero-sum” terms and are likely to face lower levels of the security dilemma; and (c) these states are likely to be involved in fewer conflicts that originate from real or imagined damage to their credibility.
 In regions where states were weak or failed at the historical moment of the normative shift, however, border fixity might have adverse consequences for international relations. Border fixity might perpetuate and exacerbate state weakness, since it deprives them of what was historically the single most potent source of state building: a threat to the states’ territorial integrity and survival. State weakness, in turn, is likely to be a major cause of international conflict because (a) it creates more civil conflicts that tend to spill across borders; (b) it encourages internal scapegoating; (c) it increases opportunities for outside (non-territorial) intervention; and (d) it might create safe heavens for international terrorism, which would invite retaliation by other states.  
The dissertation studies the effects of the border fixity norm thorough examination of eight empirical cases, which spread across time and space.

42,2005,"IN THE FIST OF EARLIER REVOLUTIONS: POST-EMANCIPATION SOCIAL CONTROL AND STATE FORMATION IN GUANTÁNAMO, 1868-1912","This dissertation charts transformations in social control mechanisms in a rural district in southeastern Cuba during the gradual demise of slavery into the opening decades of the twentieth century.  It examines how changes wrought by slavery’s end concurrent with wars of national independence against Spanish colonial rule, and American intervention into that conflict during 1898, shaped the Guantánamo jurisdiction from a colonial frontier to a North American enclave. The study contributes to scholarship on shifts in racial constructs, citizenship, free labor, and liberalism in New World Diaspora societies marked by legacies of coercive labor.
Dissimilar and distinct military mobilizations of black soldiery were salient emancipatory factors in the last three nations of the hemisphere to abandon their “peculiar institution” of slavery: the United States (the Civil War 1861-65), Brazil (the Paraguay War, 1864-70 with final abolition by 1888), and Cuba (the Ten Years’ War, 1868-78 with final abolition in 1886).  This project addresses social implications of Cubans of color and former slaves engaged in anticolonial mobilizations during the island’s transformation from colony to republican nation-state. I argue that the rebellion against the metropolitan state challenged enduring local structures of social domination and power, confronting but not overturning enduring social control mechanisms designed to defend property and discipline the colonial social order.  By 1895, a cross-racial and cross-class tactical alliance rekindled the independence struggle against Spain, and its local sources of power, extracting war taxes from landowners – an incipient politics of the social function of property.  
After U.S. occupation, and independence by 1902, that alliance did not last. In the newly constituted republic, political unrest that threatened property destruction and sabotage at sugar estates as in the nationalist rebellions met with repression.  In 1912 a black political party operating outside of established patronage networks was crushed while U.S. Marines hastened to occupy U.S.-owned properties in the district.  The repressive episode disciplined agricultural labor and black politics in the district, while planters imported contract laborers from Haiti and the West Indies in an attempt to ethnically segment the workforce and drive down wages in the early decades of the twentieth century.

45,2005,"Shouldering the Soldiering: Democracy, Conscription and Military Casualties","As the American death toll in Iraq approaches 1,800 some IR scholars may be perplexed. Only a few years ago foreign policymakers in Western democracies, including the United States, were de-scribed as being extremely sensitive to the risk of military combat casualties.  Among the factors that influence the number of casualties that a democracy will experience in conflict, one variable that should not be ignored is its military manpower system. I contend that democracies with con-script armies experience fewer combat casualties than democracies with volunteer or professional forces, all things being equal, because the societal actors most closely impacted by conscript casual-ties are more likely to have the political power and access with which to constrain policymakers.  Using several selection models I find that democracy and conscription contributes to fewer casual-ties than democracy and volunteer militaries with democracy alone being responsible for casualty numbers that lie somewhere in between.

57,2007,"Elihu Root, New York Elites, and the Creation of the Military-Industrial Complex","This dissertation examines the origins of the American establishment that dominated civilian leadership of the military for much of the twentieth century, focusing on Elihu Root’s career as wealthy corporation lawyer, New York elite, political reformer and Secretary of War.  This is a cultural study that draws from the methodology of Isabel V. Hull’s study of the military culture of Imperial Germany, but unlike Hull’s work it focuses not on military culture, but on the culture of the elites who dominated civilian leadership of American’s defense and foreign policy establishment.  In a society with robust civilian control of the military, the basic assumptions shared by these elites influenced the creation of institutions and institutional norms that limned and shaped later policy choices and decisions.  As Hull observed, 
“The motor of organizational behavior is its basic assumptions. Because these remain hidden from the actors and often contradict their stated beliefs, discovering the constellation of basic assumptions is not always straightforward. One must begin by examining the patterns in their practices. But basic assumptions are always revealed in the group’s language (which indicates categories of perception), myths, explanations of events, standard operating procedures, and doctrines.”  
By examining in detail the career of Elihu Root, the first of the “greats,” this dissertation explores these basic assumptions at the point of their creation and the impact of those assumptions on the American military establishment. That impact was first felt through the institutions Root created or shaped, and the cultural template he became for a uniquely powerful group of policymaking elites. 
The institutional reforms Root initiated at the beginning of the twentieth century marked an important break with the country’s original military traditions and created the structures that supported the transformation of the country’s military establishment. The creation of a war college, a general staff and a nationalized militia were important steps in the development of the country’s military institutions. These institutions made possible the creation of a military-industrial complex at home and the deployment of preponderant military power abroad. Newton Baker, Secretary of War during the First World War, remarked that Root’s role in creating the General Staff was “not only his outstanding contribution to the national defense of the country, but the outstanding contribution made by any Secretary of War from the beginning of history. Without that contribution from him, the participation of the United States in the World War would necessarily have been a confused, ineffective and discreditable episode.”  Equally important as Root’s institutional legacy was the legacy of leadership he created for the establishment elites who self-consciously modeled their careers after his and helped to enshrine his values and the values of his class into the ethos of civilian leadership of the military. A number of popular histories have chronicled the “small circle of men and women who … framed American foreign policy during at least the first two decades after World War II,” the people Alan Brinkley called the “icons of the American Establishment.”  At the height of their influence during the first half of the Cold War, men such as George Keenan, Charles Bohlen, Dean Acheson, Robert Lovett and Averell Harriman created and directed the containment strategy that ultimately prevailed over the Soviet Union. Seldom if ever holding offices that required subjecting themselves to elections, they exercised their power behind the scenes, leaving the stage and the spotlight to others. Like Root, they championed the interests of the political power behind America’s expansionist policies — the country’s wealthy class from whose ranks most of the establishment elites were drawn and to which the rest aspired to belong. They pursued a foreign and defense policy based on the belief that there was a seamless connection between the interests of their class, America’s national interests and the interests of the world.  They were men who shared “an unabashed belief in America’s sacred destiny (and their own) to take the lead in protecting freedom around the globe and create what Henry Luce in a 1941 Life magazine article envisioned as the American Century.” 
This dissertation explains how those establishment relationships were first created, how they operated and what gave them legitimacy. It explores how a group of elites, each connected in some way to New York’s legal and financial centers, was able to gain, exercise and maintain power over the American military establishment. It focuses on Root as the founder of the line — a wealthy corporate lawyer, New York elite and political reformer, who became first Secretary of War and then Secretary of State. While Root’s achievements in public service were formidable, he was the product and beneficiary of specific routes to power. Much of his importance derives not from the institutions he created or the reforms he championed, but from how he and others were able to exploit and sustain the conditions that brought them to power. Therefore, this is less a study of the importance of Root than a study of what his career tells us about those like him in his generation and after, the world that produced them, and the world they produced. It examines the role of institutions as gatekeepers and instruments of power, the role of social networks connecting elites and institutions, and the role of culture in creating and mediating those networks. It is a study of the creation, distribution and manipulation of power through networks and institutions based on shared cultural attributes and values, and the role of culture in creating and maintaining legitimizing authority. More than the history or legacy of one prominent elite, it is the history of a culture of power and influence and its impact on America’s military establishment.

56,2007,Rational Empires: An Institutional Theory of Imperial Expansion ,"Formal imperial expansion is a phenomenon that is poorly explained by existing
international relations and political economy literature. I present a theory of revenue
maximizing sovereigns choosing to conquer or not conquer regions based on their
institutional constraints and incentives, the institutional constraints and incentives of
imperial rivals, as well as the presence or absence of an “assurance framework” of
institutions in the target region. The model is formalized as games of incomplete
information which are solved for Bayes Nash equilibria.
I find that states with small winning coalitions have a weakly dominant strategy to
take territory, regardless of rival or target attributes, due to their inability to obtain useful
benefits without direct political control. Small W states (such as 19th century Portugal)
cannot politically sustain free trade in their own domain, and cannot even benefit from
other actors providing access to free trade zones; therefore, such states seek to acquire
formal control of territory to control the flow of private goods. For large W states (such
as 19th century Great Britain) the predictions are more complicated. They prefer to not
colonize territories and gain access to additional resources through trade. They do engage
in territorial expansion, however, when the belief in attractive institutions in the target is
low or when they are confronted with predatory small W rivals. The theory also predicts
that small W states will engage in more plunder and provide fewer public goods in their
colonies and hold these colonies longer; while the converse should be true in colonies
taken by large W actors.
Employing primary and secondary sources, I test the theory against alternative
arguments to account for patterns of European imperial expansion in nineteenth-century
tropical Africa and China – explaining the large scale formal acquisition of territory in
Africa and the lack of such acquisition in China. In addition, a longitudinal study of
British India is executed to test the hypotheses regarding the provision of public goods
and plunder as British domestic institutions evolve over time.
The dissertation both explains and predicts broad patterns of behavior in the
international system and displays relevance to current foreign policy. For example, in the
current Iraq conflict the Bush administration’s initial goals of transplanting Western-style
liberal democratic institutions now seem untenable. “Rational Empires” describes the
characteristics of an assurance framework of institutions; this would be a significantly
less ambitious, but still useful, goal. ",IR Scholarship,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
55,2007,"Who Will Serve? Education, Labor Markets, and Military Manpower","Militaries must compete with firms and other employers for high-quality
employees. Functional needs require them to invest heavily in training their employees in
“firm-specific” (i.e. non-transferable) skills, as well as in occupational and general (i.e.
transferable) skills. This kind of training is usually feasible only in combination with
guarantees for both employer and employee of significant job tenure. Functional needs
also require militaries to maintain an age and rank profile that is roughly pyramidal, with
large numbers of young, fit people and ever smaller numbers of older people. This pushes
against the economic requirements of training by making it difficult or impossible to
guarantee long-term job security for any but a small number of people, regardless of the
quality of their performance.
In order to maintain the desired personnel composition, militaries must not only
be able to offer individuals attractive employment, training, and compensation, but also a
smooth transition back into the civilian economy. This indicates that the labor market
context in which a military operates ought to have significant influence on military
personnel practices, independent of functional or strategic demands. The military must be
able to situate itself attractively within the standard career progression of an individual in
the larger economy. It must be able to communicate how it compares favorably to other
employers and how it prepares individuals for employment after their service.
Scholars of comparative political economy have documented systematic
differences in national market structures. These practices, expectations, and institutions
form self-reinforcing and clearly distinct equilibria, and it is difficult for any actor to
engage in non-equilibrium behavior. I argue that militaries will have to diverge from a
purely functional personnel management policy towards policies concordant with
national education, training, and contracting practices (I.V.s). I expect the different
infrastructures to make certain human resources tasks easier and others more difficult,
suggesting the possibility that militaries in different economic contexts might exhibit
different functional competencies due to differences in personnel management.
I explain differences in military selection and accessions policies, occupational
specialty assignments and training, and separations policies. These are the policies most
directly shaping an individual’s entry into, career within, and exit from the organization. I
use qualitative data including policy analysis, expert interviews, and some descriptive
statistics to test my hypotheses. I find that, although the picture is very complex and not
all of my expectations are borne out, the overall pattern is striking in the extent to which
military human resource practices differ systematically with their economic contexts.
The first main implication of my findings is that it is very likely that different
militaries will in fact have different operational competencies. A second implication is
that governments wishing to implement reform of any kind in the military must pay
particular attention to personnel issues and especially to how military personnel policy
interacts with the civilian market structure. It is not enough to look to other countries for
“effective” practices. Finally, I provide both further support for and interesting challenges
to the Varieties of Capitalism arguments about systems of complementarities. ",Other,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
53,2007,A Theory of War Expansion,"While most international conflict research focuses on the onset, escalation,
duration, and outcome of wars -- often ignoring the effects of third party participation
(i.e., expansion) on the war process -- the absence or presence of third-party participation
directly affects how a war unfolds. While 80% of interstate wars do not expand to include
third-party states, those that do expand are often the deadliest in terms of fatalities.
Indeed, among all interstate wars between 1816 and 1997, the 20% that expanded
account for a full 88% of the fatalities. These statistics reveal two diametric puzzles: 1)
Given the strong interests third-party states have in which side wins each war, why don't
more wars expand? 2) Given the high costs of participating in war, why do so many wars
expand? In short, while all wars have the potential to expand, why do some wars expand
while others do not? More to the point, what determines whether and when a third party
will join? I offer a theory of war expansion that explains these two puzzles.
I argue that a third party's decision whether or not to join an ongoing war is
informed by three interconnected relationships: 1) that between the original belligerents
themselves, 2) those between the original belligerents and each third party considering
joining, and 3) those between each third party and all other third parties. Additionally,
each third party's decision is based on the current dynamics of the war (which side is
winning, which is losing, and by how much), its belief about the future evolution of the
war with and without its participation, and its belief about which other third parties will
join and on which side. In short, war expansion is complex and dynamic, requiring a
theoretical model that can capture the relevant relationships as well as the shifting
dynamics of the war itself.
Extant theoretical models of war expansion focus on a single third party's decision
to join and do not account for how this decision is influenced by: 1) each third party's
belief regarding the joining decisions of all other third parties and 2) the dynamics of the
war itself. One of the reasons current models ignore these parts of a third party's decision
is that the theoretical tools (decision and game theory) employed become mathematically
intractable when asked to handle more than three actors, not to mention dynamics. I offer
agent-based modeling as the most appropriate tool to explain why and how wars expand.
 I develop an agent-based model to run computer simulations in an artificial
international state system. After running the simulations in this artificial world under
varying initial conditions, I examine the emergent behavioral patterns of third parties
during the simulated wars, as well as the effects of third-party intervention on the
dynamics of these wars. These emergent patterns serve as theoretical predictions (i.e.,
hypotheses) of the real-life behavioral patterns that should emerge in the real-world under
parallel conditions. I then subject the hypotheses to empirical evaluation using statistical
analysis to evaluate how well the predictions withstand empirical scrutiny of real-world
data.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
52,2007,Multilateralism under Unipolarity: A Study of Post Cold War US Military Interventions,"In the lead up to the 2003 Iraq War, political analyst Robert Kagan argued that
“we are in a novel situation in world history where one nation has such overwhelming
power and the capacity to act unilaterally”9
—an assessment that many international
relations scholars share.10 In contrast to U.S. alliances during World War II and the Cold
War, allies today offer relatively little in terms of shifting the power balance. Yet the
United States still acts multilaterally.
Why does the United States seek allies to do what it had the capacity to do alone?
Acting alone would give the US freedom of action to pursue its objectives, without
having to gain authorization from and coordinate goals with allies and international
organizations (IOs). Advocates of unilateralism have suggested that a state such as the
US, with a viable unilateral option, might be wiser to intervene alone rather than
undertake costly bargaining and incur constraints to its decision making.
In spite of its structural advantages, in 7 out of the 10 interventions since the end
of the Cold War, the US has aggressively sought broad multilateral support. For
example, in 1994 the US vigorously recruited and obtained 19 allies to participate in the
1994 Haiti intervention intended to remove their military from leadership.11 The US had
a clear material advantage over Haiti’s 7,600 person military, and military victory was
almost guaranteed. What do the case of Haiti and other multilateral post-Cold War
military interventions say about the cooperation costs of multilateralism versus the
benefits for a state with preponderant power? What explains the observable variation
between the multilateralism associated with the Haiti intervention and, conversely, cases
in which the US is more willing to abandon its coalition-building efforts and intervene
more unilaterally, as in Iraq? These are the questions this dissertation addresses.
Research Design
This research is not a study of whether to intervene or not to intervene, but rather
the basis for hegemonic choices between unilateralism and multilateralism in US military
interventions. By way of guiding that study, I evaluate several deductively generated
hypotheses—domestic politics, normative constraints, and international and regional
structural checks—and add one inductively generated hypothesis—a state’s time horizon—theoretically. I then evaluate those hypotheses against the empirical record of
post-Cold War US military interventions. I conduct macro level analysis of all
interventions in this period and then detailed case studies and cross-case comparisons of
the Gulf War, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Iraq interventions to test the hypotheses and assess
causal arguments. Since this set of interventions includes “most-likely,” “least-likely,”
“deviant,” and “within case variation” cases for multilateral cooperation, they help test
and build a cooperation theory of military interventions.12 Each case study analyzes the
payoffs of varying degrees of cooperation over the course of an intervention and distills
the conditions that contributed to the particular cooperation outcome, using data sources
such as declassified intelligence reports, diplomatic cables, memoirs, open source defense
analysis, and original interviews with military and civilian leaders, to inform the
inferences.
These particular cases and interventions in general are relatively well-studied in
terms of their military strategy, tactics, and outcomes, but are still understudied in the
context of international cooperation behavior and strategic interaction. Conversely,
issues of international cooperation and strategic interaction are well-studied in the
domain of economics, but not in military cooperation, which introduces a unique, highstakes set of security challenges. This inquiry bridges the understudied gap between the
intervention and logic of cooperation literatures. The result is a framework that explains
the set of conditions under which a state with the material power to intervene alone is
instead likely to cooperate multilaterally.
The Argument
While domestic politics and normative constraints explain some of the variation
between unilateralism and multilateralism in post Cold War interventions, I find the most
support for the time horizon argument. According to this thesis, the best determinant of
multilateral versus unilateral outcomes is a state’s time horizon across two phases of the
intervention: the authorization and operation phases.
In the authorization phase,13 time horizon is a function of the imminence of threat.
An imminent threat is likely to favor unilateralism because it increases the state’s
discount rate and makes future gains less attractive than immediate payoffs. In the
context of cooperation, a state is thereby more likely to circumvent the costly delays of
the multilateral bargaining process and undertake the intervention unilaterally even if it
means foregoing the future payoffs of multilateral burden-sharing. In contrast, more
distant threats will lengthen a state’s time horizon by reducing the discount rate and
making the longer-term benefits of operational burden-sharing and diminished physical
constraints on US assets more attractive.
 In the operational phase,14 time horizon is a function of the expected duration and
resource intensity of the combat and post-combat phases of the mission. Long conventional conflicts or operations other than war that are expected to have lengthy
durations will favor multilateralism; the anticipation of many repeated iterations means
more opportunities for cooperative burden-sharing for the same fixed, up front
cooperation costs. While the hegemon’s power is preponderant relative to other states, it
is not unlimited. The US therefore seeks optimal outcomes in terms of cost and benefit
and will favor the course of action that maximizes its returns; long shadows of the future
in the combat phase mean greater potential gains from cooperation and incentives for
multilateralism. Missions such as strategic airstrikes or quick, decisive operations, in
contrast, will mean fewer opportunities for cooperative interaction, which shortens the
operational shadow of the future and therefore favors unilateralism.
Research Implications and Relevance
The war in Iraq prompted lively debate on the US propensity for unilateralism
versus multilateralism. That debate, however, is still unresolved in both the academic
literature and policy communities. On the academic side, Stephen Brooks and William
Wohlforth have raised the prospect that unilateralism is a temptation of unipolarity, while
John Ikenberry argues that unipolarity may create opportunities for unilateralism but is
not a sufficient condition in part because “enduring incentives are likely to keep the US
rooted in multilateralism.”15 In the policy community, advocates of the “new
unilateralism”16 have argued that the unipolar power should not constrain its freedom of
action by imposing multilateral constraints without considering the foregone benefits of
multilateralism; the proponents of multilateralism have often lauded the burden-sharing
benefits of multilateralism without calculating the cooperation costs associated with it.
This research helps mediate both sets of debates. It first addresses the more
theoretical question of whether choices of unilateralism are a function of US power or
rather whether other factors are better predictors of US decisions to circumvent
multilateral channels and intervene unilaterally. By systematically analyzing the costs
and benefits of unilateral and multilateral approaches to military interventions and
assessing how those payoffs accrue over time, this research also addresses the policy
debate of whether and when multilateralism pays for a state with a unilateral option for
intervention.",Miltary History,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
54,2007,In the Crosshairs: The Targets of Unconventional Violence,"My dissertation develops our understanding of the selection of targets in conflicts
characterized by unconventional violence. Unconventional violence is used by non-state,
often clandestine actors with political goals, and does not utilize an army to engage an
enemy. As the conflicts in Iraq and Israel have demonstrated, this type of violence has
been used against a wide variety of targets such as civilians, infrastructure, military
operations, and government officials. Is it the case that this variation is simply the result
of non-strategic actors using violence in indiscriminate ways? On the other hand, is there
some method to what appears to be haphazard madness? I argue that violent group's
targeting strategies are strategic, and that they are shaped by two forces: the structure of
the targeted government and the counter measures that the targeted government pursues.
The former defines the range of possible targets, while the latter influences the way in.
which the targets are attacked. Comprehending how these forces work leads to a more
nuanced understanding of issues such as why civilians are attractive targets, when attack
will be particularly lethal, and which groups may choose to attack government and
military targets.
This project explores these ideas in several chapters using mixed-methods to
maximize the validity of these claims. The first chapter utilizes a large- N statistical
analysis of conflicts from 1968 through 2006 to test how government structure impacts
the targeting strategy of violent groups. The second chapter analyzes on how regime
change impacts target selection by exploring how changes in Turkish regimes have
shaped the actions of Kurdish separatist groups in that country. The third chapter focuses
on the lengthy conflict in Northern Ireland. This chapter examines how county and
national level administrative changes influenced the strategy of the Provisional Irish
Republic Army. This chapter provides a rich analytic narrative and a time-series
empirical analysis of targeting trends since 1970. Finally, the fourth chapter investigates
the impact of counter measures on a group's strategy. In this chapter I develop an original
dataset of Israeli counter measures used against Palestinian groups. I then examine how
these measures shape the wav Palestinian groups have attacked Israeli targ",Nonstate,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
147,2008,Yesterday’s Answers or Tomorrow’s Solutions? The Cold War Diplomacy of Cyrus Vance,"This dissertation examines Cyrus Vance’s approach to Soviet-American relations
during the Carter administration by focusing on five specific situations: the SALT II
negotiations completed in June 1979, the American reaction to the crisis in the Horn of
Africa in late 1977 and early 1978, the normalization of relations with China in late 1978,
the American response to the “discovery” of the Soviet combat brigade in Cuba in the
summer and early fall 1979, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan beginning in
December 1979. Vance’s worldview and diplomatic priorities are identified and placed in
the context of prior American strategies of containment and détente. Vance believed that
his central responsibility was to preserve the security and promote the prosperity of the
United States, and not to prevail over the Soviet Union in a battle for global influence or
to remake the world in an American image. Vance was a realist when it came to narrowly
defining national interests, was cautious and circumspect in situations that might escalate
into a superpower confrontation, and was optimistic that much of the world would
eventually gravitate to political and economic systems that had more in common with the
United States than the Soviet Union. Yet he was also the visionary within the Carter
administration who believed that the conflict between the superpowers in the 1970s was
less about irreconcilable ideologies and national interests, but instead was rooted in the
barriers of mistrust which had built up over the prior three decades. ",IR Scholarship,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
145,2008,Sherman was Right”: The Experience of AEF Soldiers in the First World War,"When the United States declared war in the spring of 1917, American men went to war with idyllic visions of warfare.  This presentation explores the state of mind of the AEF soldier during the Great War, an issue that has challenged scholars in the field since the troops returned home.  With the use of Military Service Records (questionnaires) issued in 1919 from four states as its core source, this dissertation argues that the American cultural glorification of warfare created an impetuous doughboy, who believed war was a game and the path to manhood.  Employing these neglected firsthand descriptions of the war in the uncensored words of veterans provides understanding of American military identity; it removes the uniform and studies the individual – whether it is an aristocratic New Englander who hungered to prove his masculinity or an African American blacksmith fighting for his equality.  Cultural differences aside, the naïveté of the doughboy was overwhelming; he believed the war would be an enjoyable adventure, but learned General Sherman was right – war is hell.",Military History,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
146,2008,"Miser, Grafter, Slacker, Coward: Doughboys, the YMCA, and the Moral Economy of Sacrifice in America during the Great War","During the First World War, approximately two million troops served with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), the army that functioned as the material and symbolic focal point of America’s commitment to the defeat of the Central Powers. This dissertation examines the impact of active service and combat on the social identity of the draftees and volunteers who comprised the AEF. Reigning historiography has generally minimized the importance of those experiences as factors in the formation of distinct socio-cultural allegiances among American participants of the Great War. Instead, it has stressed the historical context of Progressive-Era reforms as the key to understanding the development of corporate identity among American soldiers in the years 1917 – 1919. This body of scholarship maintains that soldiers interpreted the meaning of their war service, and evaluated their relationship with each other and with the mainstream of American civil society, through the prism of the Progressive rhetoric of social engineering, national rejuvenation, and moral “uplift” to which they had been exposed from the moment of their induction. Exposure to the optimistic slogans of Progressive reform, coupled with the brevity of America’s active involvement in the conflict, assured that American soldiers would emerge from the war with a heightened appreciation of American socio-political institutions, culture, and moral norms. 

        This dissertation offers an alternative interpretation of the impact of the Great War on the collective and individual identities of its American participants. Using letters, diaries, and memoirs penned by enlisted soldiers and junior officers, it asserts the primacy of the war experience in shaping the socio-cultural allegiances of ordinary “Doughboys.” Collectively, immersion in the organizational milieu of the military, followed by overseas deployment, active service in France, and combat on the Western Front, represented a radical break with civilian forms of identity soldiers professed prior to the war. It was the sum of these often-traumatic experiences, rather than the Progressive indoctrination they received in the training camps, that shaped soldiers’ views of their relationship with each other and with the American home front. Under the influence of these experiences, soldiers developed a collective identity that depicted servicemen as members of an alternative social order whose values and worldviews frequently clashed with the attitudes and norms active-duty they associated with their parent society. Convinced they belonged to a closed community whose unique experiences had set them apart from the American mainstream, Doughboys emerged from the war with a collective mindset that dwelled on the fundamental differences, rather than the similarities, between those who had fought “over there” from those who remained “over here.”

144,2008,Declaring Victory and Admitting Defeat,"When do wartime events cause state leaders to change their political or military approach to a war, or try to end it?  This study answers this question by focusing on leaders’ beliefs about how war advances their political aims and the changes those beliefs undergo, and the role of emotions in motivating or suppressing those changes.  These key beliefs are conceptualized as Theories of Victory, and three key types of theory of victory—oriented toward demonstrating capability, wearying their opponent, or directly acquiring the aims—are identified. These types are used to explain how leaders interpret wartime events and, if they conclude their approach has failed, what further options (if any) will seem plausible. The motivation to learn associated with anxiety (produced by novel bad news) and the suppression of learning associated with anger and contentedness (produced by familiar bad news and good news) are used to explain when particular series of events lead to these key changes. Three cases are used to test the theory—the Winter War (Finland-USSR 1939-1940), the Pacific War (US-Japan 1941-1945) and the Battle of France (France-Germany 1940). Results suggest the utility of the Theories of Victory typology for understanding how events are framed by leaders and the further decisions they make, and the value of emotions as an explanation for when learning happens.",Conflict between states,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
63,2008,"In the Eye of the Beholder: Capabilities, Doctrine, Behavior and the Assessment of the Adversary's Intentions","My dissertation addresses two simple, but important and understudied, questions: 1) how do decision makers (DMs) and intelligence communities (ICs) infer the political and military intentions of the adversary; and 2) to what extent do these changed assessments affect foreign policy decisions of states. To address these questions, my dissertation develops and tests three alternative theses about the perception of an adversary’s intentions – the “capabilities” thesis, the “strategic-military doctrine” thesis, and the “behavioral-signals” thesis. Using wide-ranging declassified primary documents from presidential archives, intelligence assessments, and interviews with DMs and intelligence analysts, the dissertation demonstrates that fundamental and systematic differences exist in the way intelligence communities on the one hand, and DMs within the same country on the other hand, infer the intentions of the adversary. I argue that this variation in assessments of intentions is a function of the indicators each set of actors employs to draw inferences about intentions. In both episodes, when assessments of DMs are evaluated, the evidence lends strongest support to the “behavioral-signals” thesis; whereas evidence from the IC’s estimates of Soviet intentions provides overwhelming support in favour of the “capabilities” thesis. This and other counter-intuitive findings that emerge from the empirical analysis have important implications on a range of contemporary policy debates, as well as on the soundness of some existing theories in international relations.",Conflict Between States,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
60,2008,When Heads Roll: Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Decapitation,"Leadership targeting has become a key feature of current counterterrorism policies.  Both academics and policymakers have argued that the removal of leaders is an effective strategy in combating terrorism.   Optimism regarding the value of leadership decapitation is based in part on theories of charismatic leadership and social network analysis.  However, leadership decapitation is not always successful and existing empirical work is insufficient to account for this variability. As a result, this project answers two primary questions:  Under what conditions does leadership decapitation result in the dissolution of a terrorist organization?  And is leadership decapitation an effective counterterrorism strategy?  I develop a dataset of 290 incidents of leadership targeting from 1945-2004 in order to determine whether and when decapitation is effective.  First, I identify the conditions under which decapitation has been successful in bringing about organizational decline.  Second, I determine whether decapitation is a decisive counterterrorism strategy that results in organizational collapse.   Finally, I look at the extent to which decapitation results in organizational degradation and hinders a group’s ability to carry about terrorist attacks.  This study uses cross tabulations, logistic regression analysis, event history analysis, and maximum likelihood estimation to answer the question of decisiveness.  Case studies assess the extent to which decapitation results in organizational degradation by looking at specific group’s operational capabilities and by evaluating the effect of organizational age, structure, and frequency of leadership attacks. 
The data show that a group’s age, size, type, and structure are critical in identifying when decapitation will cause the cessation of terrorist activity.  As an organization grows in size and age, it is much more likely to withstand the removal of its leadership. Organizational type is also significant in understanding the susceptibility of an organization to decapitation.  Ideological organizations are most likely to experience a cessation of activity following the removal of leader while religious organizations are highly resistant to leadership decapitation. I argue that organizational structure is essential in understanding the effect that a group’s size, age and typology has upon its resilience to leadership attacks.  Finally, the data show that decapitation is not an effective counterterrorism strategy. Organizations that have not had their leaders removed are more likely to fall apart than those that have undergone a loss of leadership.  Compared to a baseline rate of organizational collapse, the marginal utility of decapitation is negative for many groups, particularly for larger, older, religious, and separatist organizations.  
Case studies illustrate whether decapitation has an effect on the operational capacity of an organization, by identifying whether the removal of key leaders changes the number and lethality of attacks.  If certain organizations are more resilient than others, it is important to know when decapitation should be effective and when it could lead to counterproductive outcomes.  Overall, these findings illustrate the need to develop a new model for evaluating the efficacy of leadership decapitation and for developing effective counterterrorism policies.

61,2008,The Transformation of Political Legitimacy during the French Revolution and the Birth of Modern International Law,"The period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars has long been viewed by historians and international lawyers alike as one of “international lawlessness.” And yet, few commentators have meaningfully explored the legal upheaval of the era. In my Ph.D. dissertation, I argue that the Revolution fundamentally transformed the contemporary system of international law. I describe how in the earliest years of the Revolution, even before the Revolutionary Wars broke out, French diplomats and leaders responded to a number of crises by applying the principle of popular sovereignty in international law. These diplomatic predicaments included the incorporation of Corsica into the French Empire, against the wishes of Corsica’s former overlord Genoa; the affair of the princes possessionnés, when German lords who held lands and rights in Alsace guaranteed by the Peace of Westphalia, saw their privileges disappear when feudalism was abolished in France; and the annexation of the old papal enclave Avignon. Drawing inspiration from the rejection of dynastic government domestically in France, where political legitimacy came to be derived from the popular will, revolutionaries began to endorse the sovereign will of the people as the rightful and morally correct basis for international legal legitimacy as well. 
This novel conception of international law contrasted greatly with the existing system, based almost exclusively on treaties negotiated consensually between sovereign princes. I believe that an ideological, cultural, and discursive clash occurred between the two legal systems, which metastasized into a widespread disrespect for law by both the revolutionaries and their monarchical adversaries. Employing a range of legal theories, I argue that the resulting subversion of norms and adherence destabilized the international system and helps account, in some measure, for the outbreak of the Revolutionary Wars in 1792. Consequently, it was neither merely the crude “clash of ideologies” that past historians allege caused hostility between revolutionary France and the rest of Europe, nor the more recent conviction among scholars that traditional great-power politics alone precipitated conflict. Rather, a dynamic which undermined the rule of law was unwittingly unleashed when France elevated popular sovereignty as a principle of international law; and this explains, in part, the outbreak, length, and brutality of the era’s warfare. 
My dissertation not only suggests a new understanding of the history of international relations during the French Revolution. In depicting the emergence and entrenchment of popular sovereignty as a central legal notion, I also demonstrate the birth of the modern system of international law. More important even than content, like the idea of national self-determination, what the Revolution momentously bequeathed to the current system of law was the dialectic for its own development. At the dawn of the modern age, contemporary international law was broken and these actions justified using a new form of political ideology (popular sovereignty) or moral exigency (the rights of free peoples). This cycle would often be repeated. In recent history, in 1999, NATO bombed Serbia in support of ethnically Albanian Kosovars and its justification was a moral obligation to protect a repressed minority, even though scholars and practitioners were practically unanimous in agreeing that this action contravened the legal prohibition against the use of force without UN Security Council authorization. In a much more controversial move, the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. Bush administration lawyers and officials argued that after 9/11 the traditional rules of international behavior, most notably the rules of war, were obsolete in an era in which states must combat non-state and other “terrorist” actors. These events demonstrate that moral urgency or political vicissitudes can now be invoked to override or in fact create international law. This phenomenon is largely a legacy of the French Revolution.

Moving beyond the numerous narrative accounts of Franco-American relations in the 1960s, the paper highlights American management of NATO as a democratic alliance, emphasising the tension between the impetus to control and the necessity of avoiding any appearance of domination. The diplomatic settlement eventually crafted by de Gaulle and Johnson after 1966 holds particular salience for current debates on a possible return of France to NATO’s military structures, forty two years after de Gaulle initially forced the US to re-assess its approach towards the Atlantic Alliance.

Whereas scholarly literature and popular culture references have created specific images of chaplains and have generally focused on the concept of “role conflict” as the primary paradigm for understanding chaplain identity, I argue that chaplains’ experiences in Vietnam reveal a much wider reality. Faced with critical choices about morality, worship, and the nature of the Vietnam War, chaplains relied on pragmatic and practical solutions to resolve problems and tension. Rather than forsaking one aspect of their identity in favor of another, as military generals might suggest, chaplains managed their identities by relying on both their military and religious training.

64,2009,"Explaining Cohesion, Fragmentation, and Control in Insurgent Groups","My dissertation studies the level and nature of control and cohesion in insurgent groups. I argue that cohesion and fragmentation are caused by the interaction of two variables – the structure of the social base upon which an organization mobilizes, and the presence or absence of external material support. I test this theory using within-conflict comparisons of twenty-four armed groups in Kashmir (1984-2005), Northern Ireland (1962-2005), and Sri Lanka (1972-2008). Research in India and Indian Kashmir, Northern Ireland, and Sri Lanka has allowed me to reconstruct the trajectories of groups in these conflicts using a combination of original historical research and focused comparisons. On the basis of approximately a year of fieldwork in Indian and Indian Kashmir, Northern Ireland, and Sri Lanka, involving interviews, archival research, and secondary sources in English and Urdu, I offer a theory arguing that the interaction of two variables determines patterns of cohesion and fragmentation. First, I argue that groups based on robust preexisting social ties (a “bonding network”) are best able to maintain cooperation and control. Second, I argue that external material support, from state sponsors and/or diasporas, bolsters group cohesion. Organizations that combine a bonding network base with external support tend to be cohesive, while groups lacking both this type of social base and external support will be factionalized. Organizations with one but not the other of these attributes lie in between; some are state-reliant proxy armies lacking social integration and prone to falling out over the distributions of guns and money, while others are consensus-contingent groups that are militarily weak but socially solidaristic.

65,2009,Dangerous Deterrent? The Strategic Consequences of Nuclear Acquisition,"What is the effect of nuclear proliferation on the amount and type of conflict in the international system? Answering this question requires determining not only how the spread of nuclear weapons affects the likelihood of states to initiate conflict against nuclear powers, but also how the acquisition of nuclear weapons affects the likelihood of new nuclear states themselves initiating conflicts. While the former issue has received extensive treatment in the literature, work on the latter has only recently emerged. Without a logically-sound and historically-supported theory about the strategic consequences of nuclear acquisition, we cannot answer the broader question of what effect nuclear proliferation has on the amount and type of conflict in the world. Existing work holds that acquisition automatically emboldens weak, revisionist states to engage in greater amounts of lower-level conflict against their stronger, nuclear-armed adversaries. Acquisition does this by removing the adversary’s ability to credibly threaten to launch a full-scale conventional attack, as doing so now carries the risk of inviting nuclear use. Acquisition by such states therefore constrains their adversaries’ conventional coercive strategies, thereby providing these proliferators with a way around their relative weakness. Such logic also suggests an offensive motivation for why such states might seek nuclear weapons. I challenge the existing works' assumption that a stronger state needs or wants to rely on the threat of full-scale conventional attack to coerce a weaker one regarding the latter’s behavior at lower levels. Using a simple game-theoretic model, I find that the strong state is likely to prefer such a strategy under only the rarest conditions. I test my model against the universe of relevant dyadic cases (China vs. the Soviet Union, India vs. China, and Pakistan vs. India) as well as against a sample of extended coercion cases (China vs. the United States over Taiwan, and North Korea vs. the United States over South Korea). Showing that the model’s predictions are borne out in these as well allows me to make predictions about what nuclear acquisition could, and could not, do for weak, revisionist potential proliferators such as Iran.",Nuclear Weapons,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
66,2009,The Citizen Army of Old Regime France.,"This dissertation probes deeply into the origins of the French Revolution with an emphasis on military change and the long-term development of the French citizen army. It is no coincidence that in the years prior to the French Revolution, the French army underwent a time of confusion, soul-searching, and drastic change, rethinking the entire military structure and the philosophy behind it. This change began during the Seven Years’ War (1754-1763), when the French army had to contend with militaries of different cultures, both as enemies and as allies, in North America. The loss of this war opened the French army, and the French reading public, to different possibilities of military organization. These possibilities were further compounded by the French army’s brief foray into, and wide interest in, the American Revolution, which presented a victorious example of citizen warfare, reminding France of the universally admired ancient Greeks and Romans. The resulting changes in the French army reflected these influences, and while these reforms made the French army more effective, they also challenged the political and social status quo. As a result, French officers began thinking of soldiers as citizens, and French citizens became comfortable with the idea of being soldiers. The combined efforts of soldiers and citizens to pull down the Bastille in 1789 succeeded in arming citizens and igniting a Revolution. In addition to contributing to the historiographies of the Seven Years’ War, military reform, and the American Revolution, this dissertation shows how the military is often at the forefront of social change. More than a mere extension of political aims, war and the military that wages it has a profound effect on a nation’s character, society, and culture.",Military History,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
67,2009,Evolving to Win: Sequencing Theory of Extra-Systemic Warfare,"The central puzzle of my dissertation is how non-state actors – guerrillas, insurgents, and terrorists broadly defined – fight and defeat foreign states in war. To solve this puzzle I use what I call the sequencing theory. It views war between state and non-state actors, or extra-systemic war, to evolve over time and looks at the nature of sequence as the key to explain variation in war outcomes. I argue that chances of victory for non-state actors depend on what sequences they take in prosecuting war. I substantiate this argument by analyzing 79 extra-systemic wars fought between 1816 and 1994. Historical research offers four findings; (1) non-state actors have lost 80% of all extra-systemic wars but have won 70% in the last 60 years, (2) modern extra-systemic wars are evolutionary and consequently successful, (3) there are five types of sequences in extra-systemic war: (A) conventional model, (B) primitive model, (C) degenerative model, (D) complex Maoist model, and (E) progressive model, and (4) Maoist and progressive models are responsible for this evolution. The reason why the Maoist and progressive models are successful is because they combine three phases– guerrilla warfare, conventional warfare, and political development – in sequential fashion. This research’s policy implication for the United States is that in order to win in Afghanistan and Iraq, it must prevent its adversaries from performing well in all these three stages by adopting a sequential approach I promote in my dissertation.

68,2009,The Structure and Significance of Public Opinion in Non-Democratic Contexts,"This project addresses two direct but to-date unexamined questions: Do domestic audiences in non-democratic contexts develop preferences for their nation’s foreign and security policies? If so, how and to what extent can these preferences influence policymaking in settings where governments are not directly or obviously accountable to citizens? Scholarship on public opinion and government policy focuses on the determinants of the public’s policy preferences and, related, the relationship between these preferences and government policymaking. Both areas of inquiry, however, have been confined to democratic and Western contexts without exception. The relationship between opinion and policy in non-democratic contexts, where public opinion is deemed to matter less (if at all) and opinion data are scarce, is unexplored. By examining an array of policy issues across time in Iran, the Russian Federation, and the Palestinian Territories, this study is a first effort to fill this lacuna in opinion-policy research and, in so doing, provides new insights into the opaque world of autocratic politics. This study offers one response to opinion and policy scholar Paul Burstein’s (2003) call for the study of public opinion and government policy to be tested for greater generalizability, both geographically and in terms of policy areas. Indeed, this study goes one step further, testing the generalizability of existing findings beyond the context of the democratic state. More broadly, this study explores the internal dynamics of autocratic politics, which will generate new insights for how Western and democratic decision makers engage potential rivals. Understanding autocratic decision-making, and the constrained choice sets autocratic states may face as a result of domestic politics, can help leaders avoid conflicts that may result from a mutual misperception of intent.",ICS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
69,2009,"Bumbling, Bluffing, and Bald-Faced Lies: Mis-Leading and Domestic Audience Costs in International Relations","In a democratic society, does the public seek transparency in the foreign policy-making process, or does it only seek successful outcomes? Do electorates hold leaders accountable for the perceived truthfulness of foreign policy claims or do they only evaluate whether the policies were successful? The existing literature on public opinion and foreign policy calls the accountability role for the public “audience costs,” and specifies that concerns about audience costs constrain leaders. But the literature is not clear on what sorts of foreign policy actions incur the most audience costs and in particular whether publics are prone to hold leaders accountable for statements that fall short of the truth. This gap in the literature is notable because so much of the debate surrounding significant policy issues is couched in retrospective, normative, moralizing language. These debates make no sense if the pragmatic, forward-looking dimensions of audience costs – reliability and success – are all that exist. Rather, as I will show through a set of experiments and historical case studies, there is a complex dynamic at work between the public's desire for successful outcomes and the high value placed upon truth-telling and transparency within a democracy. Studying cases of war justifications, I argue that the public will be motivated to punish leaders perceived as deceptive, but that the severity of audience costs imposed will be affected by factors including partisanship, degree of elite unity, and the leader's response to threatened punishments.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
70,2009,Preparing for Dawn: The United States and the Global Politics of Palestinian Resistance,"Using research from the Middle East, the United States, the United Kingdom, this dissertation examines the international history of the Palestinian armed struggle from late 1967 until the beginning of the Lebanese Civil war in 1975. Based on multi-archival and multilingual research in Lebanon, the United States, and the United Kingdom, I argue that the Palestinian guerillas won the struggle for international recognition by identifying themselves with the cultural forces of anti-colonialism and Third World internationalism. By laying claim to the status of a national liberation struggle, Palestinian fighters tapped into networks of global support emanating from places like Beijing, Hanoi, Algiers, and Havana that allowed them to achieve a measure of political legitimacy in the international community and provided for the continued survival of their movement. At the same time, these efforts to emulate revolutionary movements from other parts of the world helped to reshape Palestinian national identity into a profoundly cosmopolitan organism; a product of 20th Century globalization. However, these radical visions of national liberation ran headlong into U.S. designs for global order; if radical Palestinians could create a “second Vietnam” in the Middle East, the implications for U.S. authority in the Third World could be disastrous. Through support for regional police powers like Israel and Jordan, Washington was able to mount a sustained counterinsurgency campaign that prevented a guerilla victory.

78,2010,Why Terrorism Still Does Not Work: Implications for Research and Policy.,"My dissertation challenges our most basic understandings of terrorism with respect to its consequences, motives, and the optimal government response. These three lines of inquiry are closely interrelated because it is widely accepted that the outcome of terrorism reveals its appeal, which counterterrorism measures ought to divest in order to minimize the incentive for this violent behavior. Within both the academic and policy communities, the dominant post-9/11 paradigm on terrorism is what I have identified as the Strategic Model. This model posits that (1) terrorism is an effective tactic for groups to coerce political concessions; (2) aggrieved groups are therefore turning to terrorism to maximize their political return; and (3) the international community can thus counter terrorism by divesting its political utility relative to nonviolence via peace processes, democracy promotion, or a strict no-concessions policy in the face of terrorism. The first section of my dissertation challenges the external validity of the Strategic Model, particularly its underlying premise that terrorism is an effective method for groups to compel political concessions. My principal finding is that terrorist campaigns are an inherently unproductive coercive tactic because governments resist complying when their civilians are the focus of substate attack. The second section of the dissertation proposes and tests two original theories for why rational organizations use terrorism despite its suboptimal political return. And the third section explores the counterterrorism implications if the Strategic Model is indeed wrong, and my theories on the causes of terrorism are right.",Terrorism,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
77,2010,Strong Horse or Paper Tiger? The Reputational Effects of War Outcomes,"This dissertation examines whether war has reputational consequences by analyzing the conditions under which third party actors are more or less likely to challenge combatants after the war is over. In it I develop a theory of reputational effects that emphasizes how information generated during wartime interacts with expectations and the characteristics of third party states to determine when war outcomes influence the decision making of potential challengers.  The relevance of unexpected information about the combatants’ military effectiveness is a function of environmental characteristics such as terrain and demography while the relevance of unexpected information about combatants’ revealed cost tolerance is a function of the political context including the issues under contention and the balance of power. I test this theory against competing explanations using three methodological approaches.  First, I analyze the effect that the outcomes of conventional wars have on the initiation of militarized disputes using cross-national time series data from 1816-2004.  Second, I combine qualitative historiography with time series intervention analysis to assess whether the Vietnam War and the Winter War increased or decreased the number of challenges initiated against the United States and Russia.  Finally, I use process tracing to assess whether the decision making by particular challengers in the aftermath of these wars is consistent with the causal logic of my theory.

76,2010,"Inventing the Military-Industrial Complex: Torpedo Development, Property Rights, and Naval Warfare in the United States and Great Britain before World War I","My dissertation, explores the birth of the military-industrial complex and its implications for naval warfare. The industrialization of warfare in the latter half of the nineteenth century placed a new premium on adequate research and development (R&D) for naval weapons which, like torpedoes, were often highly sophisticated and intended for mass production. Despite the common depiction of a declining Britain and a rising United States in this period, Britain actually had a decided edge over the United States in naval-industrial R&D resources. This enabled it to perfect existing technology and test new technology, while the United States had to take technological gambles. Precisely this pattern occurred with torpedo technology. In both countries, moreover, the effort to create an adequate R&D infrastructure drew the state and society into a new kind of collaborative relationship: instead of buying weapons from the private sector as finished commercial product, the state invested in new weapons at the experimental stage. The participation of multiple parties in the process of invention made it very difficult to establish ownership and therefore raised new and difficult questions about property rights. Torpedo development spawned multiple patent infringement lawsuits, including two that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Finally, the tactical and strategic implications of torpedoes revolutionized the meaning and metrics of naval power.",Military History,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
75,2010,No Oil for War: The Coercive Potential of Energy,"Does oil hold special coercive potential, and if so, why? Could a country use the threat of oil cutoff to blackmail its enemies? My dissertation argues that oil does offer significant coercive leverage, but not through the threat of economic punishment, as many assume. Rather, oil’s coercive potential derives from the devastating consequences cutoffs can have for a target’s military effectiveness – and thus its ability to win wars. If a state could cut off oil to its adversary, it could immobilize its military and render it unable to achieve victory on the battlefield. The project demonstrates these claims empirically through qualitative historical research that shows how access to oil has shaped the objectives and strategies of the major powers since the early 20th century. I argue that the conduct of World War I, the first mechanized war, was pivotal in demonstrating to the great powers the unique importance of oil for military victory. But ultimately, it was Japan’s experience in WWII that truly became every oil-importing country’s worst nightmare: the severance of Japan’s oil supply by the Allied blockade explains its leaders’ decision to surrender in the time and manner that they did. However, coercive success with oil is rare because states are strategic actors and are cognizant of this danger and take anticipatory measures to secure their supplies before coercion can happen in hopes of averting it. My research demonstrates that these anticipatory measures explicitly aimed to counter the threat of military coercion and not simply to forestall economic punishment.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In emphasizing the multifaceted nature of the U.S.-Japanese relationship, this project has two key goals. First, it frames the relationship through a lens of bidirectional influence, creating a new framework of U.S.-Japanese relations that highlights the interests and priorities held by both state’s government and people. Second, it expands this relationship beyond the governmental level to explore the impact that various socio-political groups, such as labor unions and intellectuals, both exerted and experienced within this relationship. In doing so, it focuses on the intersections between U.S. efforts to develop and implement policy in Japan, negotiations with the Japanese government, and Japanese reactions to the U.S.-Japanese relationship and U.S. Cold War strategy to emphasize how the total nature of the Cold War not only altered diplomacy, but led to the creation of new institutions, knowledge, and socio-political organizations. This project thus explores the ways in which the Cold War brought the United States and Japan together in both cooperation and conflict to consider how the complex dynamics of Cold War-era international relationships altered society and the state itself.",Cold War,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
72,2010,Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Decapitation in Counterinsurgency Campaigns,"Is killing or capturing enemy leaders an effective military tactic? Previous research on interstate war and counterterrorism suggests that targeting enemy leaders does not work. Drawing on newly collected data on counterinsurgency campaigns, I conduct new analysis on the effectiveness of leadership decapitation. My results challenge the conventional wisdom in two ways. First, counterinsurgents who kill or capture insurgent leaders are significantly more likely to defeat insurgencies than those who fail. Second, my results suggest that insurgent lethality drops when insurgent leaders are successfully removed but not when counterinsurgents mount failing bids to remove them. This finding is robust to numerous estimation strategies and model specifications. Although leadership decapitation is not a silver bullet, when taken together these results suggest that leadership decapitation helps counterinsurgents achieve their twin goals of degrading insurgent organizational capability and reducing insurgent violence.

74,2010,"The Political Effectiveness of Non-state Violence: Terrorism, Insurgency, and the Pursuit of Power","This dissertation analyzes the political effectiveness of violence employed by non-state actors. Most armed groups pursue strategic objectives that benefit their larger social movements, such as ending military occupations or discriminatory government policies, while they simultaneously pursue organizational objectives that benefit the groups themselves, such as bringing in money and recruits. This dissertation presents a two-level framework that captures these dynamics and yields theories based on combinations of group objectives, strength, and strategy that explain significantly greater variation in the political effectiveness of non-state violence than previous scholarship. The framework and its associated theory are analyzed using four longitudinal case studies of Palestinian groups—Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Hamas, and the Palestinian People’s Party (PPP)—who seek a number of shared strategic objectives while simultaneously competing over their organizational interests. These case studies, based on interviews and archival work from over a year of fieldwork in Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, and Lebanon, reveal the trade-offs these groups face in their attempts to achieve their stated goals of establishing a Palestinian state while still surviving (and hopefully thriving) as political actors. Statistical analyses of existing databases on political violence provide further support for the theory and framework against existing alternatives, which hold that certain forms of non-state violence—from terrorism to insurgency—generally work or do not work. This project enhances our understanding of the success and failures of terrorism, armed groups and their affiliated social movements, and provides insight into the trajectories of current and future campaigns.",Non-state,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
71,2010,Planning in the Shadow of the Future: U.S. Military Interventions and Time Horizons,"Rapport’s dissertation examines how elite policymakers in the U.S. government have historically dealt with transitions from combat operations to “post-conflict” activities in major military interventions, and specifically how key decision-makers have gone about assessing the costs and risks associated with the latter stages of a campaign. Drawing from research in psychology, he argues that senior decision-makers who highly value the future—or more colloquially, are ""farsighted""—place increasingly more weight on the desirability, rather than feasibility, of their policy aims as they evaluate operations that are further removed in time. Conversely, policymakers working with short time horizons are more apt to attend to the feasibility of proposed actions, but often have difficulty grasping and articulating the connection between low-level operations and the ultimate goals of an intervention. Both biases make it difficult for policymakers to judge whether the costs of consolidating victory, or “securing the peace,” are justified by the value of their ends.",Military History,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
79,2011,"Bankruptcy, Guns or Campaigns: Explaining Armed Organizations’ 
Post-War Trajectories
","Daly’s dissertation seeks to explain variation in post-war political, economic, and security environments. To do so, it assumes an organizational approach and asks, what happens to armed groups after they sign peace accords? Why do they dissolve, return to war, or form non-violent political parties? Her argument centers on the human geography of rebel and paramilitary organizations, specifically their recruitment, deployment, and post-war migration patterns. She propose that if illegal armies recruit in a geographically concentrated area and station their fighters in their home communities, the organizations will persist and transform into legitimate, political entities after disarming. In contrast, armed groups, which recruit in a dispersed fashion and deploy their soldiers away from their towns of origin, lack dense social networks and post-war physical clustering of their combatants. They are thus prone to disintegration. By bankrupting some organizations and preserving others, demobilization has differential effects on armed group collective capacity. Where it weakens a group, it destabilizes the group’s territorial bargains with the state and with other armed actors. It also creates proprietary information and uncertainty about the extent to which it has done so. As a result, resumed war becomes likely. If instead, the distribution of power within the system is maintained, the armed group will, over time, fully demilitarize and be brought into the state’s legal framework. To test the proposed causal logic, she engages in a multi-method approach and rely on rich, survey, violent event, ethnographic, and interview data on the Colombian conflict. By placing the organization at the center of the analysis, the research generates theory on several critical spheres of security studies: a) the inner workings of rebel and paramilitary structures; b) their inter-armed faction alliances and disputes; c) their dynamics with the state; and d) their interactions with civilian populations. The findings dispute the explanatory power of credible commitment problems and economic endowments in accounting for post-war trajectories.",Non-State,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
80,2011,Symbolic Force or Civilians First? Highly Capable Democracies and the Design of Peace Operations,"The design of peace operations – their political goals, military strategies, resources, and timing – largely determines their capacity to aid and protect civilians threatened by conflict. But the powerful Western democracies with the greatest ability to design and implement ambitious missions often do not intervene in large-scale humanitarian emergencies. When they do, they sometimes initiate peace operations suited to provide effective security and protection. Often, however, they pursue perverse policies that may appear ambitious in certain respects, but which are poorly designed to address civilians’ most pressing needs. How do the leaders of these states decide on the contributions they make to these missions, and on the design of the operations they initiate? Everett develops a theory of competing political incentives arising from domestic pressures both to pursue robust policies likely to save more lives, and to limit the costs and risks of contributions. Depending on the level of pressure for ambitious action and the operational environment, leaders may choose limited, perverse, or robust contributions to these operations.

81,2011,Compellence and Accommodation in Counterinsurgency Warfare,"The United States today defines its greatest security threats as insurgents and terrorists. It is trying to defeat them with a method of counterinsurgency (COIN) known as the population-centric approach. Is the conventional wisdom correct in claiming that the population-centric approach is the key to defeating insurgencies? Apparently not. This project tests the population-centric approach to COIN through a structured, focused comparison, within-case comparison, and process tracing based on archival research and interviews with participants. It finds that purported population-centric successes were not in fact conducted as such. It finds that population-centric COIN is exceedingly difficult to put into practice for reasons inherent to the paradigm. It further asks why states are only able to defeat insurgencies sometimes and develops an alternative theory of COIN success. The population-centric paradigm prescribes building strong, responsive, distributive states while strictly limiting the use of force to avoid civilian casualties. This relative emphasis grows from the assumption that the key to victory is gaining broad popular allegiance to the state and thus marginalizing the insurgency. But Hazelton finds that the population-centric approach is theoretically and empirically mistaken in its assumptions; in its relative emphasis on lots of political reform and only a little fighting; and in its mechanism of building broad popular support. State building and development are processes separate from COIN. Her findings suggest that U.S. policy goals based on the population-centric model may be over-ambitious, extremely costly, and simply impossible to achieve. She argues that COIN success since 1945 is a function of a heavy reliance on the use of force plus limited, targeted political accommodations that together degrade insurgent capabilities in an iterative process of compellence. The state succeeds by fighting, harrying, exhausting, threatening, conciliating, rewarding, and showing the other two key actors – the insurgency and the populace – that guerrilla victory is impossible. Success is not primarily about killing, although at times the counterinsurgent may kill many people. It is primarily about using force to deny victory to the insurgency.

83,2011,The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions Revisited: An Empirical Analysis Using a Bargaining and Enforcement Framework,"While scholars have studied the conditions under which states impose economic sanctions, few have systematically examined the question of enforcement, particularly when sender governments are willing to enforce their sanctions laws against their firms. Kwon’s dissertation revisits the question of sanctions effectiveness from a domestic politics perspective. Borrowing insights from bargaining theory, she argues that the effectiveness of sanctions is a function of the ability or willingness of sender states to enforce sanctions laws against their own firms. That is, sanctions are more likely to be effective when sender governments strongly enforce sanctions on their firms to suspend their economic transactions with the target state. This builds on the notion that sender governments not only benefit from successfully coercing the target state but also from the revenues their firms bring home from trading with the target. This implies that sender governments may have disincentives to enforce their sanctions policy, given that the restriction of business transactions with target states may undermine their firms’ competitiveness relative to other foreign firms. It further suggests that while sanctions imposition may have political purposes, enforcement often serves as a tool for governments to allow their stronger firms to force their competitors out of the target’s market. In the first empirical chapter, she tests her theory using large-N quantitative analysis on economic sanctions between 1971-2000, drawing on data from the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions (TIES) project.",IR Scholarship,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Second, she shows how the confidentiality of a mediation allows a leader to offer peaceful concessions and avoid domestic punishment. Her results show how public benefits from supporting its leader who potentially backed down in private: peace is more likely, and any ensuing war is more likely to be won. She draws from field work to show how audience uncertainty allowed for the success of the 1998 peace accords between Ecuador and Peru. She also uses statistical analyses to show how domestic pressure and war expectations alter the choice over conflict resolution forums, and their potential success.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He focuses on the three Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean: Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. He argues that the process of empire building in the Caribbean that propelled the United States to a position of global dominance in the aftermath of World War II allowed Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican elites—the individuals most familiar with U.S. empire building in the world—to restructure the hegemonial relationship between the U.S. and their own societies and influence the trajectory of U.S. policy toward Latin America. Their proximity to the United States, their understanding of the historic relationship between el Norte and Latin America, and their own personal experiences with U.S. empire building in the Caribbean provided these non-U.S. actors with a solid understanding of U.S. power that they used to challenge American hegemony and enter and influence the U.S. policy-making process from within.

While many scholars and practitioners believe that agreements with monitoring and verification measures are more effective, some agreements fail to include these provisions. My dissertation investigates the way states design security cooperation with their adversaries, and how their choices for agreement provisions are constrained and motivated. The project is innovative in bringing an institutionalist lens to a traditionally security issue, while focusing on an agreement provision –information sharing – which has thus far been overlooked by institutional design scholars. I develop an essentially rationalist theory, arguing that a rival’s domestic political volatility informs a state’s beliefs about that adversary’s future incentives to cooperate, and the greater uncertainty which such volatility creates affects choices over different kinds of monitoring provisions in treaty design. I test the explanation using cases studies in US-Soviet and India-Pakistan cooperation as well as an original dataset of all arms control agreements and their provisions from 1800-2010.",IR Scholarship / Nuclear Weapons,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first part of the dissertation analyzes how credit costs affect the probability of victory in war. The results demonstrate that the costs of borrowing have a substantial effect on war outcomes, and that these costs are more important for democracies than autocracies. Having motivated the importance of sovereign credit in war, I examine why investors are willing to finance government wartime borrowing. I challenge the conventional wisdom that investors have dovish preferences by arguing that investors prefer how the uncertainty of conflict outcomes creates lucrative investment opportunities. To support my argument, I examine two case studies of international and domestic lenders’ preferences for lending for conflict purposes. In addition to these case studies, I use event study analysis - a statistical method common in finance and economics - to find that sovereign lending markets' reaction to war is conditional. I conclude with a statistical examination of sovereign debt’s impact on war decisions. My findings have implications on the study of state capacity, mobilization, and the political economy of war.

Within three years, the social, political, and economic changes the Plague ushered in irrevocably altered the landscape of Europe and set the stage for the rise of the West in the Early Modern Period. Specifically, my dissertation will illuminate the effects of the “Great Plague” upon military requisitioning in England during the Hundred Years’ War. Through the evaluation of various relevant English financial records, I am comparing the Crécy Campaign before the plague in 1346-47 with the post-plague campaign in 1359-60 that ended in the important Treaty of Brétigny. Both campaigns included long, destructive chevauchées through the French countryside before ending in lengthy sieges of strategically significant cities. Both campaigns required extensive domestic logistical organization as well as international transportation of manpower and goods obtained from the population to the theaters of operation. As such, by comparing these two campaigns, the immediately differences wrought by the “Great Pestilence” will become readily apparent. Specifically, my dissertation will display how the English Crown had to alter its practices after the Black Death when requisitioning victuals, weaponry, and manpower in order to survive in an atmosphere of inexhaustible war and severely diminished population. These new and more effective ways to obtain materials needed for military campaigns, as well as for government survival, eventually permeated Europe writ large. They, in turn, created the military-fiscal states wealthy enough to fuel the Military Revolution and the Rise of the West in the Early Modern Period. As such, my dissertation will contribute to studies of the Black Death, medieval logistical historiography (a burgeoning field), and finally the principal debate within the field of military history: the causes, conduct, and outcome of the Military Revolution.

90,2012,Resolve in International Politics,"Why do some actors display remarkable persistence in war, while others ``cut and run"" at the first sign of trouble? Both political scientists and policy-makers alike typically answer this question by pointing to variations in resolve, but although we use resolve to account for almost every phenomenon in the study of international security – from decisions at the bargaining table, to developments on the battlefield, to deliberations at the ballot box – we have trouble explaining why some actors are more resolved than others, and tend to tautologically infer resolve from the outcomes we’re using it to explain. I connect the International Relations literature on resolve with a burgeoning body of work on willpower in social psychology and behavioral economics, arguing that political scientists seeking to explain variations in resolve in military interventions need to disaggregate the costs of war, and look at how specific dispositional characteristics (time and risk preferences, cultures of honor, and trait self-control) affect the extent to which actors are sensitive to the human costs of fighting and the reputational costs of backing down. To test the theory, I employ a multimethod approach that studies resolve at multiple levels of analysis, with both experimental and observational data: first combining laboratory and survey experiments to find evidence for resolve’s psychological microfoundations at the individual level, and then investigating these same variables in the observational realm, using Boolean statistics to study resolve as a determinant of the duration of great power military interventions from 1946-2003. The findings have implications for the study of military interventions, public opinion about conflict, and international security more broadly.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
89,2012,Breakthrough Problems and Military Strategy,"This paper examines why decision makers often find it so difficult evaluate their progress when pursuing strategic breakthroughs, especially in the context of military strategy. Existing theory (including prominent literatures on optimal stopping, bandit problems, and the bargaining model of war) predicts that the longer decision makers go without achieving their objectives, the more pessimistic they should become about their ability to do so – this paper challenges that assumption and explains why there are many cases where we should expect the very opposite. The crux of the theoretical argument is that standard models of learning and adaptation revolve around the assumption that decision makers are observing repeated processes – but there are many cases where decision makers are instead dealing with cumulative processes which follow a different logic. After presenting these concepts, the paper applies them to evaluate U.S. military strategy during the American Indian Wars. This experience is unusually well-suited for a study of strategic decision making because more than 100 tribes fought against the United States: it is thus possible to take commanders’ expectations and compare them against a relatively large body of objective empirical evidence. To be specific, the paper employs a new, event-level data set comprising roughly 3,000 frontier engagements. The paper closes by drawing implications of the theory for decision making in fields beyond national security.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
87,2012,"Secrecy, Acknowledgement, and War Escalation","Why do states use secrecy? Despite secrecy’s obvious relevance to world politics, practical and historical considerations have created a kind of “publicity bias” in which the International Relations discipline holds far richer theories of the motives for publicity rather than privacy. My dissertation helps correct the imbalance by specifically investigating why outside states intervene in ongoing military conflicts covertly rather than overtly. Extant theories of secrecy point to two intuitively plausible motives: the desire to surprise a state’s adversary or to shield its leaders from harsh domestic scrutiny. Yet puzzles remain. For example, covert interventions are frequently known by adversaries and third party states alike while, in many cases, intervention is either popular or overlooked on the home front. I present a third logic for covert intervention: managing the risks of conflict escalation. Fears that “local” conflicts will spiral up to continental or global war motivate both the intervening state and, in a tacit form of collusion, witnessing states to diplomatically conceal or ignore the outside involvement of other major powers. This kind of “joint impression management” reduces escalation risks by steering system-wide perceptions towards a view that the war is a lower-stakes local struggle. This, in turn, mutes hawkish domestic demands for retaliation and de-links the conflict outcome from the reputations of the meddling powers. I test this explanation against other logics of secrecy through comparative analysis of the Korean War, the Spanish Civil War, and the covert American military aid program in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. I select these cases carefully to obtain within- and between-case variation in the secrecy practices of states while also demonstrating the applicability of the argument to a broad temporal span. The findings shed light on policy debates, such as the use of armed drones, and the delicate normative balance between foreign policy secrecy and democratic accountability. In my presentation at TISS, I will focus on the Korean War (1950-1953). ",Conflict between states,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
86,2012,"Stationed in the Borderlands: Black Troops and Double Consciousness, 1940-1953","This dissertation will examine and analyze the experiences of African American servicemen in World War II through the lens of double consciousness.  I argue that the black experience in the U.S. military and encounters with different cultures overseas changed and raised consciousness in African American troops in both productive and destructive ways.  In turn, this new consciousness contributed to racial progress and new attitudes on the homefront upon their return.  Using an interdisciplinary approach to this topic, I will incorporate oral testimonies from black veterans, theory on double consciousness, and elements of 1940s black literature to provide a comprehensive cultural overview of the black community in general and servicemen in particular.  This study also makes a critical connection between World War II and the Civil Rights Movement.  The veterans’ stories and their role in the black community played an important role in the desegregation of the U.S. military and subsequently in further progress toward equal rights.  A deeper analysis of the black military experience at that time provides both a deeper understanding of the troops’ personal psychology but also a more comprehensive picture of the implications of black service in the Second World War.

91,2012,Destructivity: The Political Economy of Military Effectiveness,"This dissertation attempts to provide an overarching framework for understanding the sources of military effectiveness, or ‘destructivity’ as I term it on the analogy of productivity in economics. Following from Stephen Biddle’s ‘modern system’ concept, high destructivity armies are those which can successfully devolve power to low level leaders, especially non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and junior officers. This, however, requires that these low level leaders have a strong foundation of military knowledge, so that they can devise their own solutions to novel problems on the battlefield. Low levels of basic literacy, poor recruitment performance in the civilian economy and political interference in officer selection and promotion through ‘coup proofing’ can all hamper the acquisition of this knowledge and lead armies to adopt policies of rigid centralization, which in turn lower destructivity. I first test this theory using macro-comparative statistical data from a variety of sources and find that basic literacy has the strongest effect on destructivity. By contrast, many other popular theories in the literature on the origins of military effectiveness – such as ethnic heterogeneity and geopolitical vulnerability – are tested here for the first time and found to have no significant effect on destructivity. In addition to my quantitative work, I use qualitative case studies of two Armies – those of Iraq under Saddam Hussein and Germany in the World Wars – to illustrate my causal mechanism, including new archival material from the Conflict Records Resource Center and interviews with retired Iraqi military personnel.

150,2013,"“Progressives in Navy Blue: U.S. Naval Professionalization and the Birth of a New Strategic Paradigm,
1873-1923","My dissertation traces how intellectual and institutional developments within the U.S. Navy forged
new concepts of strategy, strategy-making, and strategic culture between 1873 and 1923. Within this context
of strategical transformation, I also examine how the progressive movement influenced naval officers.
Traditionally, strategy was treated by naval officers as an ancillary discipline—a skill set practiced
during wartime, but largely neglected when peace prevailed. However, during the 1870s a new “strategic
consciousness” emerged as part of a larger professionalizing project instigated by a small but energetic group
of progressive naval reformers. Supported by civilian navalists, these reformers established new institutions
which incubated fresh approaches to maritime strategy and strategy-making.
The strategic metamorphosis was not a smooth process, as contending forces vied to control the
navy’s future. Both “old guard” conservatism and a strong inclination to measure “real” progress in technical
terms shaped alternative cultures of advocacy which contested the strategical agenda. Following several
decades of “churn” the new ideas and practices of strategy ultimately permeated U.S. naval culture,
transformed its professional identity, and fundamentally reordered the navy’s organization and force
structure. As the twentieth century unfolded, the new strategy-centered navy exercised unprecedented
influence on U.S. foreign policy and civil-military relations.
My presentation at the 2013 New Faces Conference highlights important aspects of my dissertation
research. Entitled “A Peculiar Beginning: U.S. Naval Intelligence and the Birth of a New Strategic
Paradigm, 1869-1889,” my conference essay links the nascent Office of Naval Intelligence to a “strategical
awakening” within the U.S. Navy following the Civil War. Within this context, I address the historical forces
and personalities behind ONI's founding, and its pivotal role as the nation's first dedicated strategic
institution.",Military History,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

94,2013,"Law, Security, and Ethnic Profiling: Italians in the United States During World War II","The balance between the protection of national security interests and the affording of civil liberties
has historically been a challenge in our democratic society and continues to be so today. During times of
crisis, the U.S. government has identified particular groups as posing a national security risk based upon
constructed profiles of dangerousness. My dissertation examines how agencies of the federal government
interacted with one another in creating and enacting various restrictions on Italians residing in the United
States during World War II, including selective internment. Through reference to case studies of the Justice
Department litigation files for alien enemies and records kept by hearing board members, I argue that there
were inconsistencies in the hearings before alien enemy hearing boards which made recommendations of
internment. Like non-punitive deportation hearings, in that they did not require the constitutional
protections granted alleged criminals, the alien enemy hearings were informal and did not follow evidentiary
standards of a criminal trial. The Justice Department’s efforts to respond to complaints about the process
through a series of remedial instructions to the hearing boards, beginning in February 1942 and continuing
through 1943, are the best evidence that the alien enemy hearings could have been uniformly fairer.
Unfortunately, for the majority of Italian internees already serving their internment within the first six
months of the alien enemy hearing program, the affording of greater due process did not affect the initial
determination of internment.
Some of the case studies illustrate the types of defective process that the Justice Department
addressed, such as the lack of formal charges against the subjects, while others exhibit the failure of the board
to admit available testimony favorable to the subject. In other instances, cultural biases of board members
and the political influence of witnesses compromised institutional standards and prevailed over objectively
measurable threats, sometimes serving to disadvantage a subject and at other times positively affecting
outcomes, such as cases where Italian American hearing board members and government attorneys were
involved. Still other cases offer narratives of a more thoughtful process, of hearing boards grappling with the
meaning of due process as it pertained to alien enemies and striving for a contextualized adjudicatory
process, and the Justice Department carefully reviewing board recommendations. Cases where multiple
hearings were held, particularly when individuals were interned longer, not only gave subjects the
opportunity eventually to address the government’s concerns, but also allowed boards to more thoroughly
examine the behavior and mindset of the subjects.
In addition to setting forth discrepancies between what the Justice Department expected hearing
boards to do and how they actually functioned, this study reveals the tension between what internees felt was
a just process for deciding whether they posed a danger to society and the then-existing legal guarantees for
alien enemies. The fact that hearings were provided at all when the law did not require them for nationals of
countries at war with the United States indicates a commitment, even in the atmosphere of war, to the
democratic ideals of justice.",Other,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
95,2013,Selective Leviathans: Explaining State Strategies of Counterinsurgency and Consolidation – with Evidence from Pakistan,"This project seeks to explain why states adopt certain strategies within civil war. Rationalists
observe state incumbents often select seemingly “sub-optimal” strategies, either brutal or half-hearted, to
combat rebellion. Most of civil war literature ignores state strategy while the counterinsurgency literature is
plagued by a Western-model bias that over studies foreign expeditionary forces and neglects domestic
incumbents fighting rebellion on their own soil. As a result both these literatures become dislodged from the
challenging context of state-building. To correct this bias, my dissertation theorizes a new dependent variable
of counterinsurgency strategy, and identifies four values or approaches—attrition, population control,
enfeeblement, and co-optation—that encompass a distinct set of military tactics and political objectives, as
well as ways to measure them. It then identifies a theory of center-periphery relations based on the value of
territory and sub-group identity to explain the conditions under which each strategy will be adopted by a
state incumbent.
This paper then tests this theory on a number of observations from Pakistan as well as some
preliminary tests of larger, cross-national data. Understanding indigenous incumbents’ strategic constraints
and incentives is central to explaining the sometimes destabilizing internal actions of insecure states and
emerging powers, actions that pose implications for civil conflict dynamics and international relations

96,2013,"Leaders, Perceptions, and Reputations for Resolve"," Can individual leaders develop reputations for resolve independent from the state? Scholars of
international relations focus nearly exclusively on how states develop these reputations for resolve. However,
recent scholarship questions this state-centric view, indicating that leaders are important actors in
international bargaining and crises. My dissertation bridges these two literatures by examining whether
leaders may develop their own reputations for resolve. Drawing from cognitive psychology, I argue leaders
can develop such reputations of their own as decision-makers will look to leader-based characteristics when
making assessments of resolve. I further argue reputations for resolve will be based on a leader’s behavior
while in office, but will be conditioned by cognitive constraints. Due to the ways in which individual decisionmakers seek out and internalize information, early actions will matter more in assessments of resolve,
making initial reputations difficult to change. Through experimental surveys and qualitative case studies, I
find robust evidence that leaders do develop reputations for resolve independent of their state’s reputation.
Further, while these reputations can be conditioned by other factors, these effects are inconsistent. These
results have strong implications for the study of state conflict behavior and for the relative importance of
leaders to international relations. ",IR Scholarship,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
97,2013,When and Why State Project Power,"A century ago, most great powers built power projection capabilities to compete over access to and
control over resources and trade. However, since 1945, most of the world’s economically powerful states
have stopped projecting military force globally. Asia’s rapid economic development has increased
interdependence while dramatically shifting the distribution of power, overturning the geopolitical
chessboard in the region. Fears over a rising China and a declining U.S. have resulted in the distant rumblings
of a naval arms race as governments scramble to upgrade their naval forces. Why have some leaders stopped
projecting military power around the globe and why do some new powers appear to be starting again? This
puzzle motivates my two research questions: 1) when do leaders project power? and 2) why do leaders
project power? I argue that domestic political interests and institutions explain why (for what objectives)
leaders project power and international geopolitical competition explains when leaders project power. I test
my theory of why leaders project power with case studies of how leaders reacted to the exogenous exposure
of resources in the Arctic, North Sea and the South China Sea. I test my theory on when leaders project power
using a quantitative analysis of whether leaders build power projection capabilities.
In my presentation at the 2013 New Faces Conference, I discuss my theory and then focus on my
study of the Arctic. I look at how different types of leaders reacted to the exogenous exposure of Arctic
resources and whether or not they projected power to compete over maritime energy reserves in the region.
Leaders’ foreign policy choices are examined before and after the shock in 2007, the year that Arctic sea-ice
receded dramatically, even more than the most aggressive climate models had predicted. The second half of
this chapter focuses on a cross-regional comparison of how leaders reacted to the exposure of resources in
the Arctic vs. the North Sea. In the North Sea, rapid advances in offshore drilling technology allowed states to
drill for resources in areas
previously believed to be inaccessible. This comparison allows for a test of the theory’s predictions regarding
how leaders should behave in a region in which leaders have incompatible interests (the Arctic) vs.
compatible interests (the North Sea). Confirming the predictions of the theory, in the Arctic, I find that the
liberal leaders (U.S., Canada, and Denmark) project little power, while nonliberal leaders (states that are
resource-dependent and/or autocratic, i.e. Norway and Russia) reacted to the shock by projecting power with
greater intensity and frequency. The predictions of the theory are also supported in the cross-regional
comparison; Arctic leaders projected power while those in the North Sea did not.",IR Scholarship,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
99,2013,"Undermining Resistance: Mobilization, Repression, and the Enforcement of Political Order","My dissertation examines the use of political repression in Guatemala from 1975-1985. Three
intricately related questions are investigated: why do governments repress their citizens; what impact does
repression have on citizen decisions to engage in dissent; and when does repression end. The project
develops a novel theory of government repression that focuses specifically on attempts by authorities to
undermine overt collective challenges, such as protest or terrorism, by targeting activities that precede
and/or support such behavior. While it is often suggested that one of the key reasons that challenges are not
observed in a particular situation is because expectations of repression prevent dissidents from organizing,
existing theory provides few details on how governments might anticipate the development of overt
collective challenges or how they attempt to undermine this behavior. What this project argues is that
governments are able to subvert the development of challenges by applying repression against mobilization
(i.e., forming and supporting an opposition organization from which overt collective challenges can be
initiated and sustained). Governments do not attempt to address all challengers but focus their efforts on
those mobilizing in support of highly transformative redistributions of political power. Indeed, repressing
radical mobilization is actually more effective for governments than repressing challenges because it
undercuts the organizations that support and sustain collective challenges. As a result, repression does not
end once overt challenges have been eliminated, but persists until the government has eliminated all forms of
mobilization that support of radical redistributions of political or economic power.
The investigation provides empirical evidence to support these claims by analyzing new data
collected from the confidential records of Guatemalan National Police. During most of the 20th century, the
Guatemalan National Police employed a central depository to store the records produced by the inner
workings of their bureaucracy (e.g., memos passed up and down the chain of command, arrest records, log
files summarizing daily activity, and investigative reports produced by local divisions, the central command,
or other specialized units). This warehouse and the millions of documents it contains were abandoned in
1996 and lingered for approximately ten years before being discovered and archived into newly formed
Archivo Histórico de la Policía Nacional (AHPN).
This archive provides unprecedented details on both the myriad of covert mobilization as well as
overt collective activities engaged in by challengers and the spectrum of repressive behavior employed by the
government. The digitization and archiving processes have recently been completed, and this study is one of
the first to have been granted access. During my field research at the AHPN, I constructed an events database
of political behavior participated in by mobilizers and challengers as well as all forms of repressive behavior
directed at such groups. In total, the project coded more than seven thousand acts of state and dissident
behavior. Analysis of the police data reveals how government forces employ coercion to subvert challenges
by directing repression against radical mobilization.
My paper at the 2013 New Faces Conference examines attempts by authorities to undermine overt
collective challenges, such as riots, protests, and acts of terror, by targeting activities that precede and/or
support such behavior. After providing a theory of how repression and resistance develop, the study
examines unique data drawn from the confidential records of the Guatemalan National Police to assess the
use of repressive action during the years between 1975 and 1985. Empirical tests demonstrate that 1)
government forces anticipate challenger development by identifying the mobilization activities nascent
challengers rely on to initiate and sustain overt collective challenges; and 2) that the use of repression to
undermine such efforts is specifically designed to contain the spread of radical (i.e., highly transformative)

98,2013,The Determinants of Volatility in Foreign Policy,"To the casual observer of states’ relations, countries like the United States appear to always clearly
define other countries as either allies (e.g., Canada) or enemies (Cuba). This neat separation makes it easier to
deal with everyday matters such as trade tariffs, because it allows countries to quickly discern whom to
sanction and whom to support. There exists, however, a sizable subset of states—India and Pakistan among
them—whose relations are more volatile, that is, they are characterized by inconsistent shifts between
episodes of intense cooperation and episodes of bitter violence. For instance, in January 2011 Pakistan issued
a military threat to India to desist from its nuclear program. A mere week later, India forcibly accused
Pakistan of harboring terrorist attacks on Indian soil. In April of the same year, the two countries instituted a
joint working group to enhance trade ties between them. Yet, at the
beginning of May, India started conducting military exercises at the border with Pakistan, causing
Pakistan’s violent retaliation. What propels states’ relations to be volatile?
This dissertation investigates the presence of volatility in states’ foreign policy, and it offers a theory
of its determinants. Specifically, it presents a conceptualization of volatile foreign policy as being
characterized by inconsistent shifts between cooperative and conflictual actions, distinguishing volatility
from other characteristics of unstable foreign policy—such as the presence of cycles or of positive and
negative trends (Chapter I). It demonstrates that understanding volatility is crucial because volatile relations
breed violence by increasing states’ uncertainty over the likelihood of conflict recurrence, which
in turn increases the probability of conflict recurrence (Chapter II). It also shows that volatile relations
are pivotal relations, in that volatile dyads are more likely both to be more involved in crises and to
share membership of a greater number of International Organizations (Chapter II).
This dissertation advances a theory of volatility that integrates dynamics present both at the domestic and at
the international arena: states will be willing to explore cooperative policy options with
an opponent when they can negotiate from a position of power. Yet, contrary to common expectations,
the presence of multiple institutional constraints will lead to more, not less, volatility: when foreign
policy-making authority responds to multiple and heterogeneous domestic interests, states will be less
likely to establish a coherent foreign policy, because satisfying those domestic interests will often require
to engage in a diverse set of activities. Thus, the interaction between heterogeneous domestic
institutions and the power position in the international system will make states more subject to volatile
behavior (Chapter III). I test this theory of volatility complementing existing event datasets with originally
collected event data on the foreign policy interactions of rivals for the years 1948–2009. I then build an index
I of institutions’ heterogeneity, to measure the degree to which the foreign policy of a country is the reflection
of an heterogeneous set of multiple domestic interests (Chapter IV). Finally, I set to analyze the impact of
volatile relations on a recent episode of foreign policy: the developments of the “Six Party Talks,” the ongoing
negotiations between South Korea, North Korea, China, US, Russia and Japan over the acquisition of nuclear
capabilities on the part of North Korea (Chapter V).
To investigate volatility in the international arena, this dissertation utilizes a number of diverse
methodological tools: the definition of the concept of volatility is obtained through concept formation
analysis (Chapter I); the impact of volatile behavior on uncertainty is tested with a heteroskedastic
probit model, and the pivotal role of volatile relations is assessed through a bivariate probit (Chapter
II); the identification of volatility in the relations between states is obtained through the Box-Jenkins
analysis of the time series of foreign policy interactions; the theory of volatility is tested with panel
data models—such as the Arellano-Bond specification of dynamic models, as well as panel data models
with fixed effects, random effects and panel corrected standard errors. Finally, I set to analyze the
impact of volatile relations in the case of North Korea’s nuclear weapons acquisition process applying
a longitudinal social network analysis perspective on the interactions between the parties to the “SixParty Talks” through Temporal ERGMs (TERGMs) and SIENA models.",IR Scholarship,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
100,2014,War Exhaustion and the Stability of Arms Treaties,"Why do states acquire nuclear weapons? Existing theories of nuclear proliferation fail to account for the impact of bargaining on the process—i.e., credible agreements exist in which rival states make sufficient concessions to convince the potential rising state not to proliferate. This dissertation proves the existence of that range of settlements and the robustness of the inefficiency puzzle. It then provides two main explanations as to why states proliferate anyway. First, if the would-be proliferate expects to lose the ability to construct nuclear weapons in the future, the states face a commitment problem: the rival state would like to promise to continue providing concessions into the future but will renege once proliferation is no longer an option. And second, if the proliferator's rival faces some sort of uncertainty—whether regarding the potential proliferator's ability to go nuclear or regarding its previous proliferation activity—the optimal offer can entail positive probability of nuclear investment. However, the nonproliferation regime's mission to increase the cost of building often leads to Pareto improvement.

108,2014,"A Lost Peace? The Superpowers and the Middle East Impasse, 1967-1979","My dissertation centers on the question of why the United States and the Soviet Union proved incapable of cooperating to achieve a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement during the period between the end of the 1967 Six-Day War and the conclusion of a separate Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979. The failure of the two superpowers to cooperate to bring about a final resolution to the Middle East conflict is quite puzzling, given that such a joint approach would have offered both Washington and Moscow significant strategic advantages. Indeed, for the Americans a superpower-brokered arrangement would have settled a long-standing dispute, the consequences of which routinely affected U.S. interests in a geopolitically vital region of the world, and assured Israel’s existence and security. Likewise, the Soviets would have made gains in the Arab world for their role in bringing about a final deal and solidified the U.S.S.R.’s great power status. Moreover, both sides would have benefitted from strengthened bilateral ties, which would have helped create a more stable international security architecture and reinforced the budding détente between them. In short, while strategic imperatives would have suggested that the Americans and Soviets ought to have collaborated in the Middle East, no such arrangement ever came about. I examine this puzzle by exploring six main variables, namely, bipolarity, the influence of nuclear weapons, misperception/mistrust, domestic politics, the impact of the preferences of the superpowers’ regional clients, and the role of individual leaders. Using a methodology of robust process-tracing that relies heavily on recently declassified primary source material, my dissertation sheds light on the major empirical, historical, theoretical, and policy relevant questions associated with this subject.",Conflict between states,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
106,2014,“Economic Interdependence and the Kantian Peace: Determining Whether and How Economic Linkages Reduce Militarized Conflicts,"The large body of research investigating the relationship between economic interdependence and a reduction in conflict has, on balance, demonstrated a correlation between the level of economic exchange and a reduced probability of a militarized interstate dispute. These studies have largely limited their focus to the relationship between these general phenomena, however, and have failed to test and establish a relationship between domestic economic interests and foreign policy decision-making. This is problematic because the causal logic of interdependence rests on the assertion that national political leaders are constrained by economic actors whose interests would be harmed by the initiation or escalation of violent conflict. The goal of this dissertation is to establish a crucial test for interdependence theory by directly assessing whether key political actors respond to economic interests with policies aimed at reducing military tensions when disputes between economically interdependent states arise. The central causal mechanism of interdependence theory will be tested through a process-tracing research design on a medium-n qualitative dataset of all economically interdependent strategic rivals (Colaresi, Rasler and Thompson 2007) since 1870. Additionally, a more detailed case study of Colombia - Venezuela economic and security relations (1980 - 2010) will include interviews with key political decision-makers. These results will be aggregated on a success-failure continuum to further investigate the boundary conditions, such as political institutions and the severity of threats, which may mediate the effectiveness of economic interdependence to reduce militarized conflicts.

101,2014,Petty Despots and Executive Officials: Civil-Military Relations in the Early U.S. Navy,"This dissertation explores the evolution of civilian control in the United States Navy from its creation in 1794 to the establishment of the Board of Navy Commissioners following the War of 1812. It argues that, while civilian supremacy was unchallenged in the early republic, the exact nature of the relationship between military officers and their government was never clearly spelled out. Over time, secretaries of the navy proved willing to allow senior officers substantial autonomy managing the internal affairs of the navy and especially in their handling of subordinates. There was never a clear set of guidelines for the relationship beyond an assumption of civilian control, and officers routinely tested the bounds of their authority. The specific parameters of the relationship had to be renegotiated with each new secretary. No Secretary of the Navy wished to turn his officers into automatons, however. Successive secretaries did recognize their officers’ expertise and experience, if not always to the degree officers wanted, and sought to give sufficiently broad orders to avoid stifling captains’ talents. All the secretaries of the navy in this period even tolerated a measure of insubordination and internal squabbling from officers who proved not only competent, but aggressive in the face of the enemy. Meanwhile, officers perceived as lazy or timid were forced out of the service. Aware of America’s weakness vis-à-vis Europe’s powers, Federalist and Republican Presidents alike rewarded captains who proved zealous and even reckless in defending the nation’s honor. William Jones, appointed Secretary of the Navy in the midst of the War of 1812, tried to alter this mindset and encourage caution in the face of the mighty Royal Navy, but he met with limited success. Attitudes of aggressiveness in the face of combat and loosely interpreting orders were too ingrained in the officer corps to be wiped away in a matter of months.",Civil-military,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
102,2014,“Multiparty Mediation: Identifying Characteristics of the Mediation Dream Team,"The substantial variance within multiparty mediation efforts has significant implications for the usefulness of mediation in conflicts seeking a peaceful resolution. Multiple mediators sometimes complicate the negotiating environment, decreasing the chances of peace and giving multiparty mediation a reputation for ineffectiveness. In particular, multiple mediators can result in forum-shopping, mixed messages, and freeriding. Not all multiparty efforts, however, are equally plagued by these problems. Moreover, some multiparty efforts provide unique advantages that make them better able to influence the combatants and generate an agreement. These advantages not only increase the probability of a negotiated settlement, but also of successfully implementing the settlement and producing a lasting peace. This project explores these differences, providing a more nuanced theoretical framework for considering the effect of multiparty mediation on conflict resolution. Beginning with the assertion that mediation is a club, and as such is vulnerable to overcrowding, this project explores the ideal composition of mediation teams. As a heterogeneous club, some potential mediators are more desirable than others. Desirable mediators balance the team's biases with regard to the disputants or provide a complementary source of leverage. Additionally, coordination within the team minimizes the risk of overcrowding. Therefore, the mediation dream team is a 4 coordinated, balanced, and complementary collection of international actors. To evaluate these assertions, new data on mediation team coordination was collected. Additionally, new measures of balance and complementary mediation efforts were developed. The statistical analyses conducted confirm that these differences in multiparty mediation efforts have significant and substantial influence on mediation success.",IR Scholarship,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
105,2014,"The Justice Dilemma: International Criminal Accountability, Mass Atrocities, and Civil Conflict","How does the justice cascade—the rapid trend toward holding leaders accountable for gross human rights violations—affect political violence? I argue that international justice produces both positive and negative effects by influencing the post-tenure fates of leaders. By undermining the possibility of a safe exile for culpable leaders, international justice incentivizes such leaders to cling to power and gamble for resurrection when they would otherwise flee abroad. Yet, for exactly the same reason, international justice also deters atrocities. Since leaders know that committing atrocities will decrease their exit options if they need to flee abroad, international accountability effectively increases the cost of atrocities. Taken together, these predictions form a dilemma: the justice cascade reduces the incidence of atrocities, but it also undermines conflict termination efforts after atrocities occur. To test my argument, I examine the arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet in the United Kingdom in 1998—the first time a leader was arrested in a foreign state for international crimes—as an exogenous shock to other leaders’ beliefs about the likelihood of posttenure international punishment. My results offer compelling support for the theory. Whereas culpable leaders are no more or less likely to flee abroad than nonculpable leaders before 1998, culpable leaders are about seven times less likely to go into exile than nonculpable leaders after 1998. Rather than flee abroad, culpable leaders now have incentives to fight until the bitter end. Indeed, while there is no evidence of a relationship between leader culpability and conflict duration before 1998, I demonstrate that civil conflicts last significantly longer when culpable leaders are in power during the post-1998 period. This dark side of justice, however, creates a benefit: deterrence. Since leaders want to keep the exile option open in case they need it, leaders are about five times less likely to commit atrocities after 1998 than they were previously.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

my research seeks to +illustrate how Reagan’s unlikely foray into nation building shaped the social, economic,
and political contours of U.S.-Latin American relations beyond the end of the Cold War. My project also

104,2014,"Protection States Trust?: Major Power Patronage, Nuclear Behavior, and Alliance Dynamics","Why do some states that receive a nuclear security guarantee move towards, and sometimes back away from, nuclear weapons? To answer these questions, I propose alliance compensation theory. I argue that allies become more likely to engage in nuclear behavior when they doubt the reliability of the security guarantees they receive from their major power patrons (e.g., the United States and the Soviet Union). Specifically, I show that allies evaluate the strength of these guarantees by referring to their patron’s overseas conventional military deployments and foreign policy doctrines – in short, its strategic posture. When the nuclear-armed patron implements undesirable conventional military redeployments (e.g., unilateral troop withdrawals), the ally loses confidence in the patron’s earlier pledges to provide it with military support in a future nuclear crisis. These doubts encourage the ally to adopt policies that range from signaling an interest in a nuclear arsenal to activating a nuclear weapons program. Allies that covertly undertake nuclear activities are seeking to produce an independent deterrent. Allies that overtly engage in nuclear behavior are also bargaining over the terms of their patron’s security guarantees. I further argue that the interaction of two variables – the ally’s economic and security dependence on the patron – affect the major power’s ability to force the ally to credibly renounce nuclear weapons acquisition. To test this argument, I include three main cases on West Germany, Japan, and South Korea in addition to narrower cases on the United Kingdom, France, and Soviet allies. I also draw on statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between conventional military withdrawals and the likelihood of US allies to engage in nuclear behavior.",IR Scholarship,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
107,2014,The Constraining Power of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime.,"This dissertation examines how the nuclear nonproliferation regime, and international security institutions more generally, affect the behavior of states. These institutions seem to defy existing theory: punishment is difficult and information hard to come by, yet security institutions often boast near-universal membership and seem to enjoy high levels of compliance. I argue that these institutions can effectively constrain state behavior because states use the accession and compliance decisions of others as important clues about the efficacy of an institution and about the underlying policy preferences of members and non-members alike. I test my hypotheses using data on states’ pursuit of nuclear weapons and their membership in the various international agreements that make up the nuclear nonproliferation regime. I not only identify strong support for the constraining power of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, but also find that the decision of a state to seek nuclear weapons is conditioned to a surprising degree on the compliance of the overall population of member states. At the same time, how the international community responds to a state’s nuclear weapons pursuit depends heavily on the extent to which it is embedded within the larger regime complex. My findings have important implications both for the literatures on international security and international institutions— where the constraining role of security institutions has largely evaded in-depth treatment—and for the ongoing policy debate over the efficacy of the nuclear nonproliferation regime theory and policy. With regards to international theory, I show that weaker allies do have coercive bargaining leverage over their stronger allies. When confronted with unfavorable changes to their patron’s strategic posture, allies sometimes used the threat of acquiring nuclear weapons so as to ensure that their security guarantees would remain credible. Thus, in maintaining a hegemonic order that prioritizes nuclear nonproliferation, the strong sometimes suffer as they must. The weak are not passive players in high-stakes security relations in international politics. With regards to policy, credibility and reputation matter. Accordingly, because the United States faces pressure to scale down its military commitments abroad, it must do so in a manner that does not alienate allies so as to provide them with incentives for nuclear weapons acquisition.",Nuclear Weapons,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
109,2015,Selling Her the Military: Recruiting Women into the United States Armed Forces in World War II,"The onset of World War II precipitated a labor shortage throughout the United States. The increasing demand for men in both industry and the military drove many employers to search for new labor pools – white women and men and women of color. This project will consider the ways in which women were recruited into the United States military, beginning with the first legislation in 1942, and ending in 1945, when the war ended and new recruits were no longer needed. This project considers the recruiting campaigns for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, including posters, magazine advertisements, and radio spots, and process by which the campaigns were developed. It will show a conversation within public relations and recruiting departments, as well as the conversation with the women encountering the materials in public spaces. This project will further demonstrate that the recruiting campaigns had the unintended result of changing how gender was perceived in the United States.

Beginning with the first American Evangelicals to move to Israel in the 1950s, I examine a tightknit group of missionaries and organizational leaders who, in response to their experiences abroad and growing institutional and intellectual ties between Israel and the United States, developed a cluster of ideas I have termed “Interfaith Evangelicalism.” These ideas rethought traditional Christian understandings of Jews and Jewish missions, and emphasized Christian support for Israel and the “Jewish roots” of Christianity. Intersecting with broader conversations about Judeo-Christianity, interfaith dialogue, and Holy Land tourism, Interfaith Evangelicalism emerged, after the Arab-Israel War in June 1967, as a primary conduit for Israel and the American Jewish Committee (the most engaged American Jewish organization on issues of interfaith relations) to court American Evangelical leaders.

111,2015,Who Can Keep the Peace? Insurgent Organizational Control of Collected Violence,"The United States and other members of the international community have expended billions of dollars and thousands of lives confronting insurgent organizations across the globe. Strikingly, however, there has been little analysis of how some groups have developed the military capacity to challenge superior forces. The importance of this question has been illustrated by the recent rise of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Yet, existing research provides limited insight as (1) it has not conceptualized military eﬀectiveness in a sub-state context, and (2) it is focused on structural determinants of insurgent behavior. Thus, I construct a conception of insurgent military eﬀectiveness capturing distinctions such as insurgents’ inability to keep ceasefires or to control who is targeted by violence as well as a theory arguing that it is not the resources organizations have that determine eﬀectiveness, but how well their organizational structure allows them to leverage those resources. In particular, the theory focuses on both informal structures of social support and formal military structures such as logistics, command and control, and personnel management systems in explaining how some insurgent organizations achieve relatively high levels of military eﬀectiveness and others do not. After using a large-N analysis to demonstrate that structural factors are poor predictors of organizational structure and conflict outcomes, I test my theory with in-depth case studies of groups from Vietnam (1940-1975) and Iraq (2003-present) using archival documents, interviews, and secondary sources. My research untangles puzzles such as how, in Vietnam, the Viet Minh and Viet Cong became so successful while other nationalist and religious groups did not or, in Iraq, how the so-called Islamic State has operated with such military prowess. My findings also help to clarify existing research—such as the study of fragmentation during civil war—while providing precise suggestions about managing sub-state violence by better identifying and training partners, crafting and maintaining peace agreements, and addressing poor governance that perpetuates conflict.",Non-state,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
112,2015,Credibility in Crisis: The Role of Leadership Beliefs in State Threat Assessments,"Why is it that some threats are believed credible by states during crises, while others are not? How do target states interpret coercive signals intended to establish threat credibility during these periods? Any detailed, systematic investigation of these questions is largely missing in International Relations (IR). In brief, and counter to standard rationalist and power-based theories, I argue that variation in leadership beliefs within a target state are key to understanding how threatening signals are interpreted during crises. Research within political science has shown that decision makers’ differing belief systems and assumptions about the nature of international politics can hold important implications for political outcomes. I build on this research to argue that a target state’s prior interactions with an adversary determine its leader’s beliefs and expectations regarding the extent of that adversary’s interests and satisfaction with the status quo. Beliefs about an adversary’s interests and goals feed into a target state leader’s perception of his or her threat environment, helping to clarify the primary sources of potential insecurity. Leaders prioritize their threat environments based on these beliefs and allocate states resources to those threats deemed more urgent than others. When future crises arise, a target state leader’s prior beliefs act as important lenses, filtering information and determining how signals are received and interpreted, with important implications for assessments of threat credibility.  I build and test this theory through the comparative historical analysis of five carefully selected interstate crises – the Suez Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Sino-Soviet Border Crisis, the Falklands War, and the Iraq War 2003. This project offers important insights to policymakers and academics alike. In terms of its theoretical import, the findings of this dissertation contribute to theories of crisis bargaining, foreign policy decision making, and recent work linking regime type to war. Beyond its academic significance, this dissertation also aims to provide policymakers with a better understanding of the limitations inherent in interstate communication, as well as to identify some conditions under which signaling mechanisms can be employed effectively to convey U.S. resolve in the future.",IR Scholarship,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
113,2015,Evaluating the Changing of the Guards: Survey Evidence from Liberia on Security Sector: Female Ratio Balancing Reforms,"What role does gender play as post-conflict countries strive to re-establish confidence in their domestic institutions?  Since 2000, The United Nations has embarked on an ambitious agenda to female ratio balance the domestic institutions of post-conflict countries as a means to establish long-term peace and stability. This paper builds on this wisdom by suggesting that female ratio balancing in the security sector meets three possible criteria for restoring trust in the domestic institutions of post-conflict countries: constraint, inclusiveness, and transformation. Using this logic, female ratio balancing as a security sector reform has the potential to increase confidence in domestic institutions and thereby create the right conditions for peacekeeping transition.   The argument is tested using original surveys conducted in post-conflict Liberia.  All expectations received empirical support.  The findings suggest that policies related to gender may contribute to improving trust in the state, thereby exhibiting the importance of considering gender in theories related to post-conflict peace building and international relations more broadly.",IR Scholarship,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
114,2015,Extracting the Eagle’s Talons: The Soviet Union in Cold War Latin America,"While the Cold War in Latin America has been examined from a variety of angles, the scholarship on Soviet-Latin American relations is thin, outdated, and based almost totally on published sources. Moreover, much of the literature is replete with misconceptions about the nature of the Soviet approach to the Western Hemisphere and the relationship between Moscow and its regional allies. Using a case study approach, and based on substantial research in the archives of the former Soviet Union, this dissertation argues that Moscow’s approach to Latin America was more cautious and pragmatic than ideological and messianic. Rather than attempting to extend their control over the region, the Soviets instead sought to pry Latin American regimes away from dependence on the United States and to encourage the region to adopt a non-aligned foreign policy. To a degree heretofore not sufficiently appreciated, this approach involved the clever use of international organizations, particularly the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. Moreover, Latin American communists and Soviet sympathizers were hugely influential in shaping Moscow’s perceptions of the region and its relationship to the United States, and in pressuring Soviet leaders to provide more support to their regional allies.",Soviet Union,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
115,2015,"The Control War: Communist Revolutionary Warfare, Pacification, and the Struggle for South Vietnam, 1968-1975.","The Second Indochina War, like all armed conflicts, possessed a unique spatiality. Although often called a “war without fronts,” the reality is that it was a war with innumerable fronts, as insurgents and counterinsurgents wrestled to seize political power and to control territory and population throughout forty-four provinces, 250 districts, and more than 11,000 hamlets. The contest for South Vietnam was not one geographical war, but many; it was a highly complex politico-military struggle that fragmented space and atomized the battlefield along a million divergent points of conflict. Like other irregular civil conflicts, the key to winning political power in South Vietnam was to control both the physical world (territory, population, resources) and the ideational world (the political organization of occupied territory). The means to do so was insurgency and pacification – two approaches that pursued the same goals (population and territory control) and used the same methods (a blend of military force, political violence, and socioeconomic policy) despite their countervailing purposes. This dissertation explores the highly complex and irregular spatiality of the Second Indochina War and examines the ways that both the communists and the Republic of Vietnam and its American ally conceptualized space and utilized geography and the environment to serve strategic, tactical, and political purposes. It argues that the war was shaped, and in large part determined, by spatial and environmental factors. The natural and the manmade world were not only central but a decisive factor in the trajectory / outcome of this irregular conflict. The study is intended to enrich our understanding of the war in Southeast Asia and shed further light on this unique conflict (and other irregular wars) by highlighting dimensions (spatial and geographical) that heretofore have been marginalized or overlooked within straightforward political and / or military analyses.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
116,2015,Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy,"How does the acquisition of nuclear weapons affect the foreign policies of the states that acquire them? Despite its critical importance, this question has not yet been answered satisfactorily. My dissertation aims to make three contributions in answering this question. First, I offer a new typology of conceptually distinct effects of nuclear weapons on foreign policy that allows us to move beyond catch-all terms such as “emboldenment.” In particular, I distinguish between independence, bolstering, aggression, expansion, steadfastness, and compromise, and show theoretically that nuclear weapons may facilitate (i.e., reduce the expected cost of engaging in) each of these behaviors. Second, my dissertation theorizes the circumstances in which we should expect to observe these different effects of nuclear acquisition. While nuclear weapons may facilitate each of these behaviors, not all states find each of these behaviors equally attractive. I argue that a sequence of three binary variables—the presence of severe territorial threats; the presence of allies that provide for the state’s security; and the state’s power trajectory—predict the foreign policy behaviors that are most attractive to the state, and, thus, the uses to which nuclear weapons can most profitably be directed. The theory therefore makes determinate predictions for the changes in state foreign policy that should be expected to occur in the aftermath of nuclear acquisition, based on observable variables that can be measured prior to nuclear acquisition. Third, the dissertation tests this theory against three alternative explanations using historical case studies of the UK, South Africa, and the United States, all of which draw on multi-archival research.",Nuclear Weapons,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
120,2016,Securing Control and Controlling Security: Civil-Military Relations and Conflict Processes,"My Dissertation is comprised of three essays that investigate how civilian elites secure over military and how this dynamic both affects and is affected by civil and interstate conflict.The first essay examines civilian control as it relates to the military’s ability to stage a coup. While scholars have argued that the norm of subjugation within the military is central to civilian control, few studies have tested this claim. I do so by constructing and validating a measurement model that generates continuous, yearly estimates of civilian control for all countries from 1946 to 2010. I incorporate the presence of norms through a dynamic modeling structure, and find that doing so improves model performance, suggesting norms of subjugation are both self-reinforcing and a critical component of civilian control. 
The second essay uses this measure to examine variation in foreign policy within and across regime type. I argue that weak control of the military increases the incentive of political leaders to adopt preventive foreign policy strategies and initiate international disputes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I find that that these relationships are strongest for democracies and party-based autocracies, indicating that civilian control is most tightly linked with foreign policy decision-making in regimes where civil-military relations are typically assumed to be strongest. The third essay reverses this causal arrow to examine how security threats shape civil-military relations. Civilian elites fearing military takeover often engage in coup-proofing strategies, but there is little consensus about whether and when these strategies are effective. I develop a conditional theory of coupproofing effectiveness, arguing that such strategies will be effective when a state is faced with international rivals, but counterproductive when a state is faced with threats from domestic rebels. I find strong empirical evidence for these claims.

Dozens of authors have written on the armies, the weapons, and the fighting in the battle, but none have focused on the tremendous achievement of more than 300,000 civilians, mostly women, who labored under German fire for several months in 1943 to ensure the Red Army a defensive system that would guarantee victory in the final significant German offensive of the war. My dissertation tells the heretofore untold story of how the Kursk Communist Party leadership, three Soviet army groups, and the Moscow political elites coordinated myriad construction projects that were ultimately crucial to the Soviet victory. In so doing I shed light on civil-military relations as well as center-periphery tensions in the Soviet system.

121,2016,Persuading Power: Insurgent Diplomacy and the International Politics of Rebellion,"My research examines how rebel groups use international diplomacy as a strategic tool to advance their domestic war-time objectives. From the Trent Affair of 1861, to Yasser Arafat’s speech at the United Nations in 1974, to Syrian opposition lobbying today, acts of insurgent diplomacy have defined some of the most memorable and important events in international politics. Yet rebel groups can choose to engage with different types of actors, solicit different types of assistance, and have a diverse set of political-military objectives motivating their diplomatic strategies abroad. My dissertation therefore asks: What explains variation in the strategies of diplomacy rebel groups employ to solicit third-party support? I argue that how rebel groups approach international politics is directly linked to the domestic balance of power between rebel groups and their enemies, as well as intra-insurgent competitive dynamics. More specifically, variation in rebel diplomatic strategies are a function of: 1) the military viability of a rebel group, which affects the type of intervention rebels seek from outside actors; and 2) the degree of fragmentation within the broader insurgent movement, which affects who rebels solicit such support from. To test my argument, I conduct an analysis of the Iraqi Kurdish (1958-1990) and Palestinian (1959-1988) national movements. These case studies make use of 62 original interviews with 48 Kurdish and Palestinian officials, as well as primary-source archival work in Erbil, London, Ramallah, and Washington. Importantly, I employ the private archive of a former Kurdish diplomat, providing unparalleled access to correspondence between Kurdish leaders and third-party actors. From the Trent Affair of 1861, to Yasser Arafat’s speech at the United Nations in 1974, to Syrian opposition lobbying today, acts of insurgent diplomacy have defined some of the most memorable events in international politics. International diplomacy is a ubiquitous feature of insurgent politics because it is intrinsically linked to how groups pursue third-party political and military support. However, although war-time diplomacy is central to insurgent politics, scholars still cannot explain the substantial variation in insurgent diplomatic strategy, or the ways in which diplomacy is employed by groups over time. This article examines the varying strategies of insurgent diplomacy, and more specifically, when and why rebel groups focus their diplomatic attention on certain international actors over others. I argue that variation in the diplomatic strategies of rebel groups is driven by domestic intra-insurgent dynamics within the conflict zone. More specifically, rebel groups’ targets of diplomacy are a function of the degree of fragmentation within the broader insurgent movement. When an insurgent movement is deeply fragmented, diplomacy is likely to target the central government’s foreign adversaries. However, when an insurgent movement is united, and focused more intently on undermining the central government, groups will seek support from the state’s international allies. To demonstrate these dynamics, this article looks at shifts in Iraqi Kurdish diplomatic strategy from 1958 to 1990. The analysis makes use of 37 original interviews with 28 current and former Kurdish diplomatic officials in Iraqi Kurdistan, Europe, and the United States, as well as archival documents from the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series and the private archive of a former Kurdish leader and diplomat. Documents from the latter archive include minutes of leadership meetings, letters between Kurdish leaders, and most importantly, external letters between Kurdish leaders and foreign governments, political parties, international and non-governmental organizations, and private individuals.

119,2016,A Prelude to Violence? The Effect of Nationalism on Interstate Violence,"Nationalism has long been cited by political scientists as a culprit of violence between states. My dissertation advances a new theoretical framework that uniquely combines two levels of analysis—namely, the individual and state levels—to elucidate the effect of popular nationalism on the initiation of international conflict. International relations scholars have either dismissed nationalism as epiphenomenal or have assumed that it increases the likelihood of interstate violence. Contrary to these conventional views, I claim that popular nationalism has a stabilizing effect and does not always lead to conflict. Popular nationalism can have diverse effects, as it induces two distinct foreign policy preferences at the individual level: nationalistic sentiments make individuals prefer not only hawkish foreign policy means but also complete success as a foreign policy outcome. A nationalistic public’s demand for complete success prevents leaders from hastily jumping into international conflict in the face of rising nationalism, for it dramatically increases the domestic costs of a failed conflict and the likelihood of paying such costs. Consequently, a conflict-inducing effect of nationalism appears only when leaders have firm belief in the likelihood of complete success or are politically vulnerable but lack repressive tools to deal with the uprising of popular nationalism, in which case they are forced to initiate a losing conflict. By combining evidence from survey and lab experiments with in-depth case studies on territorial disputes between China and Japan, and between Argentina and the United Kingdom, I found that the rise of popular nationalism has led mainly to the status quo and only rarely to conflict.

117,2016,Engaging the ‘Evil Empire’: East – West Relations in the Second Cold War,"In Cold War history, the first half of the 1980s, a five-year span during which Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko, and Mikhail Gorbachev all held power, is frequently overlooked by scholars who jump from détente’s demise with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to the storied Reagan-Gorbachev relationship after 1985. The intervening period is generally seen as one marked by Soviet instability and increasing global tensions — a “Second Cold War” more dangerous than any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Based on extensive archival research in Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States, demonstrate that this characterization is incomplete: Ronald Reagan’s desire to stabilize US-Soviet relations in fact predated his election in 1980. He consistently took unpublicized steps to that end beginning shortly after his inauguration, an approach which the Kremlin reciprocated. This back-channel engagement with Moscow did not become overt until early 1984, however, when Reagan was sufficiently confident in the United States’ relative military and economic power vis-à-vis the Soviet Union to make these efforts public. This project expands our understanding of the Reagan presidency, the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War using new international evidence; and it offers insight into the roots of cooperation between adversarial states.",Conflict between states,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
126,2017,"More Talk, Less Action: Why Costless Diplomacy Works During Power Transition","Why do declining powers take rising powers' cheap claims about limited intentions seriously? Power transitions are a tough test of cheap-talk because the incentive to misrepresent drives rising powers to understate, not overstate, intentions. Even aggressive types promise their aims are limited, and these promises cannot be validated for years. Using a formal model, Michael Joseph argues that rising powers credibly signal their long-term intentions by tying demands for specific concessions (e.g., Taiwan) to underlying principles (e.g., nationalism). Declining powers could ignore diplomacy but prefer to evaluate if words and deeds are consistent. Thus, diplomacy sets a benchmark to evaluate future behavior against. The author presents an elite survey experiment that simulates a National Security Council assessment of an emerging threat and randomly assigns diplomatic messages and military interventions to subjects.

127,2017,"Experiments in Peace: Asian Neutralism, Human Rights, and the Transformation of the United Nations, 1946-1966","This dissertation examines how the neutral states of the Third World shaped the development of international human rights during the Cold War. In the 1940s and 1950s, newly independent states in South and Southeast Asia organized themselves into an informal alliance based on a common posture of resistance to security alliances. These neutralist leaders then identified the United Nations as a site for building prestige, finding coalition partners, and securing their independence from foreign intervention. A core argument of this dissertation is that one of the overlooked legacies of this transnational project was the imprinting of Third World concerns into the International Bill of Human Rights, the textual foundations of the international human rights system. Far from disengaged, Third World leaders imported their concerns into the drafting of human rights instruments, transforming its conceptual premises to include the collective right to self- determination and to force the United Nations’ participation in decolonization. By reconceptualizing the role of the Third World in the Cold War, this dissertation offers the first full length study of the International Bill of Human Rights from a global perspective across the twenty years of its creation, from 1946 to 1966. It draws on archival sources from across ten countries in five languages to advance our historical knowledge of the Third World and its impact on international relations during the Cold War.",Cold War,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
128,2017,Fully Committed? Religiously Committed State Populations and Foreign Policy Formulation,"This dissertation argues that the higher the level of religious commitment within a state’s population—that is, the higher the level of importance assigned by citizens to religious identities and ideas—the greater will be that state’s propensity for initiating conflict. The project follows a three-article model and contains three interlocking empirical studies, each speaking to religion’s role in conditioning interstate conflict and connections between domestic culture and global politics. The first article uses a case study of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’stenure as prime minister and president of Turkey to build a theory connecting popular religious commitment to state conflict behaviors. Drawing on insights from the literatures on audience costs, diversionary war, and elite cues, the theory posits that in highly religious societies, leaders compete with political challengers for the support of their religious citizens and are incentivized to publicly spiritualize foreign threats in hopes of benefitting from “rally-round-the-sacred-symbol” effects. Yet, by framing foreign affairs as having implications beyond the material world, leaders encounter political costs for failing to adequately confront threats, increasing the likelihood that they will follow through on bellicose rhetoric. The second article employs a large-N statistical study to establish a cross-national connection between higher population proportions of religiously committed citizens and higher probabilities that states will initiate conflict against others, corroborating the system-level expectations of the first article’s theory. The third article uses an original survey experiment to test the micro-foundations of the religious signaling dynamics that play a key role in the theory. It shows how elites can successfully spiritualize military actions, using targeted religious rhetoric, to garner the support of religiously committed individuals.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
130,2017,"Straddling the Threshold of Two Worlds: Soldiers’ Culture in the U.S. Army in Vietnam, 1965- 1975","This dissertation explores how American soldiers used American mass culture to make sense of their experiences and to forge a shared culture during the Vietnam War. Throughout the war, soldiers remained acutely engaged with American consumer culture, which was accessible to an extraordinary degree in Vietnam. The nature of the troop forces in Vietnam contributed to this ongoing and intimate engagement with American mass culture. That most soldiers came into the service for a brief period, many through the draft, and had no intention of making a career in military service only exacerbated the tendency for cultural rupture and change on the home front to influence soldiers’ behavior in war. Each new cohort of replacements brought with them a ‘cultural inventory’ of ideas about, among other things, the civil rights movement, the counterculture, politics, and a perception of what military service meant. While soldiers brought these ideas with them to Vietnam, the U.S. Army purposefully outfitted military bases with the trappings of American mass consumer culture that provided various cultural mediums for reinforcing or challenging what soldiers’ believed about the war and the meaning of citizenship and military service. Vietnam became a place where soldiers renegotiated their place amid a host of political and social currents during the Sixties.",Military History,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
123,2017,U.S. Army’s Investigation and Adjudication of War Crimes Committed by American GIs during the Second World War,"This dissertation examines the U.S. Army’s response to serious violations of international law committed by American soldiers in the Mediterranean and European Theaters of the Second World War. Focusing primarily on violence perpetrated by American soldiers against Axis POWs and foreign nationals, it looks at how the U.S. Army’s military justice system – from the officers and senior enlisted men at the front tasked with reporting and investigating violations of international law to the judge advocates, generals, and statesmen tasked with trying and punishing perpetrators – responded to a persistent, widespread, and difficult problem. Whereas 5 | Page previous studies have tended to focus on two questions surrounding war crimes committed by Americans during the war – those of motivation and frequency – this study largely eschews those questions in favor of procedural ones. By focusing instead on how the army responded as an institution and how its legal system handled serious crimes against foreign nationals, this study expands our understanding of how American military justice functioned at the front lines and how that system was hindered by the difficult realities of war at the front. This study also makes use of new and previously unused sources. Instead of the memoirs, oral histories, and letters that scholars have previously used to examine war crimes committed by Americans, it draws heavily on official army records – courts-martial transcripts, the correspondence of the judge advocate general, provost marshal, and inspector general’s offices, as well as numerous investigations and reports that have not been examined before. Using these sources, this study argues that the American system of military justice was consistently unable to effectively police its soldiers’ use of violence, both as a result of the inherent legal difficulties of investigating and prosecuting battlefield crimes as well as the conflicted attitudes soldiers held towards war criminals in their own ranks.",Military History,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
125,2017,Grand Strategic Crucibles: The Lasting Effects of Military Intervention on State Strategy,"When and how do military interventions shape great powers’ grand strategies? Whereas prevailing theories of grand-strategic change emphasize international-structural or domesticpolitical factors, this study demonstrates that the process of warfighting reveals new information that reshapes states’ notions of capabilities and interests. In particular, military interventions can serve as crucibles of grand strategy that test the intervening state’s theory of security against the military and political realities of warfare. Three variables determine the vector of grand-strategic change subsequent to military interventions. First, international constraints drive decisions about levels of military means, or the proportion of national resources expended on defense. If a military intervention reveals that a state faces an elevated level of threat in its international environment, the state will increase the proportion of national resources dedicated to defense; if the intervention reveals a diminished threat level, the state will respond by decreasing its allocation of resources to defense. Second, domestic constraints shape estimates of the utility of military force in achieving political objectives and thus determine the scope of foreign-policy ends sought. If a military intervention reveals greater military capabilities and/or greater domesticpolitical support for the use of force abroad, a state’s propensity to use force is likely to increase with a commensurate expansion of grand-strategic ambition; the opposite result obtains when warfare reveals diminished political will or military capabilities. The interaction of these two variables accounts for variation among four possible grand-strategic vectors: militarization, rebalancing, retrenchment, or conservation. A third variable, the level of immediate threat revealed through warfare, predicts the extent to which post-war grand strategy will emphasize deterrence and defense against future contingencies similar to the war just fought. This study develops and tests this theory using qualitative process-tracing methods in historical case studies of U.S. interventions in the Korean, Vietnam, and First Gulf Wars, based on extensive archival research.",IR Scholarship,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
131,2018,"Trust in International Politics: The Role of Leaders in Nuclear Politics, Alliances, and Conflict","In my dissertation, I focus on how leader relationships influence cooperation on nuclear issues, alliances, and conflict resolution, asking whether shared social identities between leaders make cooperation more likely. I address this question using a combination of historical cases and quantitative empirical analysis, finding that leaders with more shared social identities are better able to cooperate in international politics, even while accounting for strategic factors known to effect cooperation. Shared social identities between leaders contribute to an increased likelihood of cooperation because shared identity makes it easier to understand and trust another. My work makes the novel move of going beyond the analysis of individual leader backgrounds to think about the role and importance of relationships between leaders in international politics. Further, understanding the conditions under which cooperation is more likely, and the intersection of strategic factors alongside psychological and behavioral motivations, contributes to our understanding of international political dynamics.

 In my chapter, ``Trust in International Politics: Identity, Interpersonal Relationships, and Nuclear Cooperation,'' I consider how interpersonal relationships between world leaders influence cooperation on nuclear issues. I argue that leaders who share more similar social identities are more likely to trust each other, allowing for increased cooperation. Using data on nuclear cooperation agreements and leaders' identities, including early and adult life identities, socio-economic status, and ideology, I find that leaders who share more social identities are more likely to engage in nuclear cooperation, even while controlling for strategic factors known to influence cooperation. I illustrate these empirical findings with a discussion of Argentine-Brazilian rapprochement on nuclear issues. This research provides evidence that interpersonal relationships among leaders shape international relations in one important context, thereby contributing to our understanding of how leaders matter in world politics, and the conditions under which states can cooperate

132,2018,Planning for the Short Haul: Trade Among Belligerents in War,"In times of war, why do belligerents continue to trade with each other? In my dissertation, I develop a theory to explain the variation in state’s wartime commercial policies. I show that states set product level commercial policies to balance two potentially conflicting goals – maximizing state revenue from continued trade during the war and minimizing the ability of the opponent to benefit from security externalities of the trade. States are more likely to trade with the enemy in (1) products that their opponents take a long time to convert into military capability and (2) products that are essential to the domestic economy. The amount of time it takes the opponent to convert gains from trade into military capabilities determines which products are too dangerous to be traded during a war. The mitigating factor is the amount of revenue the state can extract from trade and from the circulation of the product in the domestic economy. The more essential the product is to the domestic economy, the less a state can afford to lose trade in it. Furthermore, I argue that changes to a state’s commercial policy during the war depend on the military progress of the war. As the expectation of the length of war increases, the number of prohibited products will increase since the opponent will have more time to benefit military from the gains of trade. Similarly, a state’s willingness to bear the cost of losing trade increases with the scale of war. The closer the war gets to being existential, the more wartime trade with the enemy the state will give up. The dissertation tests this theory using the comparative case study method, looking at four case studies – Crimean War (1854-6), World War I, World War II, India-Pakistan relationship from 1945 to 2000.",Conflict between states,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
133,2018,"Clinging to the Anti-Imperial Mantle: The Republic of China’s Encounter with the Decolonizing World, 1942-1971","My dissertation project, Clinging to the Anti-Imperial Mantle: The Republic of China’s Encounter with the Decolonizing World, 1942-71, is a critical reinterpretation of Chinese statecraft.  It aims at the restoration of the Republic of China (ROC) to its rightful historical place as an important Cold War actor. The recovery of the entanglements between anti-communist Chinese diplomats working for the government of Chiang Kai-shek and Third World nationalists provides us with a better appreciation of how the borders that emerged during the Cold War have created problems to the present day.  The dissertation explores how Chinese Nationalists, after their evacuation from the mainland to the small island of Taiwan in 1949-50, tried to locate their non-western diplomacy in between contests of postcolonial sovereignty in distant parts of the world and those at the periphery of China itself.  It shows how Republican China’s condition as a divided nation-state—proclaimed to the world as only temporary—shaped its diplomats’ approaches to building inter-national alliances.  The chapters explore:  the ROC’s elevation as a great power during World War II; self-defining maneuvers by ‘Free China’ at the United Nations in the years before the Beijing People’s Republic joined the U.N. organization; the ideology of Pan-Asianist regionalism during the Cold War; ROC connections with Catholic allies across continents; and ROC military cooperation with like-minded anti-communist governments in the 1960s and 1970s.  All in all, my work challenges simplistic accounts that trace the consolidation of ‘One China’ norms to the Sino-American rapprochement of 1971-79 under the Nixon and Carter Administrations.  Chiang’s diplomats represented one of two Chinese regimes that paraded the world stage, each as ‘an international fact,’ for over two decades.  The legacy of their activities casts long shadows on the Cross-Straits dilemma and at the U.N. Security Council to this day.",Cold War,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
134,2018,"The New Navy's Pacific Wars:  Peripheral Conflict and the Making of the Modern U.S. Navy, 1861-1898","Using a transnational methodology and sources in three languages on four continents, my research follows the entangled histories of naval development in the Confederate States of America (CSA), Peru, Chile, Japan and China as well as the reciprocal effects of those states on the formation of the “New Navy”: the first major peacetime U.S. military expansion, c. 1882-1898. Specifically it explores: the CSA during the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865); Peru and Chile during the War Against Spain (1864-1866), the War of the Pacific (1879-1884) and Chilean Civil War (1891); and finally the self-strengthening movements of Qing China and Japan, including the Sino-French War (1884-1885) and the First Sino-Japanese War
(1894-1895). 

My historiographical aim in exploring these military developments is three-fold. First, in an effort to “provincialize Europe,” I plot out the South-South connections between the navies of the CSA, Chile, Peru, China and Japan. Second, shifting perspective to the semi-periphery makes clear how “Hot Wars” in the Americas and the Pacific not only created demand for experimental naval designs, but also offered an operational laboratory for the evaluation of first generation weapons. As such, “modern naval warfare” became “modern” not solely or even primarily in the staff colleges and laboratories of the North Atlantic core, but through syncretic exchange with the semi-periphery during the late 19 the century. Finally, for U.S. politicians and strategists, the success of semi-peripheral navies with novel technologies represented at once a challenge to the United States’ “new empire” as well as two crucial opportunities: in the absence of great power war, violence around the semi-periphery provided both an enemy against which to posture and hard data about the efficacy of developmental weapon systems.

135,2018,"Stop or I'll Shoot, Comply and I Won't: The Dilemma of Coercive Assurance","There is a dilemma at the heart of coercion. Successful coercion requires not only that I credibly threaten you until you comply, but also that I credibly assure you that I will not punish you after you comply. In this dissertation, I develop and test Coercive Assurance Theory to show that coercion succeeds when credible threats are paired with credible assurance. I then test competing theories of the causes of coercive assurance credibility. Existing literature on commitment-making in international politics implies an inverse linear relationship—a tradeoff—between threat and assurance credibility. Instead, I propose that the credibility of threats and assurances may vary independently. In particular, I argue that states can generate credible assurances through two strategies: Coercive Control and Reducing Visibility. Asserting coercive control reduces target fears of capricious punishment. Visibility reduction mitigates target fears of acquiring a reputation for concessions. To investigate these competing theories, I turn to the universe of cases of coercive bargaining between non-allies over nuclear weapons programs. I code each case of “redline-making” over nuclear programs, revealing cross-national variation in coercion success. From this universe I select the cases of South Africa, Libya, and Iran for process tracing and comparative analysis. My research uses archival documents and interviews. The dissertation concludes with policy implications and a “shadow case” on North Korea. The ingredients of credible threats are distinct from the ingredients of credible assurance. Understanding coercion success and failure demands that we treat these concepts distinctly.",IR Scholarship,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
136,2018,"Unexpected Humanitarians: Albania, the U.S. Military, and Aid Organizations during the 1999 Kosovo Refugee Crisis","Using archives and oral history, this dissertation examines three forms of humanitarianism during the 1999 Kosovo Refugee Crisis: local Albanians, the U.S. military, and international aid organizations. It explores how these groups developed ethical and moral frameworks to justify humanitarianism, how this humanitarianism shaped assistance, and how they interacted with each other, as well as with ethnic Albanian Kosovar refugees, especially since these three groups differed greatly in capacity and culture. It finds that the success of refugee assistance depended not only on the capacity (financial, logistical, and material), but also on the cultures of these groups. First, Albanians developed a grassroots humanitarianism premised on the key cultural and moral concept of mikpritja, hospitality, as well as shared ethnicity. Doing so reframed refugees as guests, an underlying principle in traditional Albanian ethical and legal codes. Second, the U.S. military had an abundance of capacity, but was slow to develop a rationale for refugee assistance. Gradually from the bottom-up, soldiers reimagined their military humanitarianism as an extension of American military culture’s emphasis on protecting American civilians. Third, numerous aid organizations practiced traditional Western humanitarianism, emphasizing nonviolence and impartiality. These values fit poorly with both Albanian and U.S. military cultures and practices. This combined with aid organizations’ general lack of capacity contributed to their marginalization throughout the crisis. Regardless of the fact that these three strands of humanitarianism remained largely disconnected, their interactions still proved mutually reinforcing and successfully provided shelter, food, and assistance to over 450,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania. The dynamic between these three groups and their differing ethical understandings of humanitarianism help to illuminate a common dynamic in refugee crises, namely the need for militaries, local communities, and international aid organizations to learn and relearn how to find common ground and work together to provide humanitarian assistance.",Military History,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
