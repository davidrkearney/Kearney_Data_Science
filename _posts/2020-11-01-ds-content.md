## Economics and Data Science

[An Economistâ€™s Value in Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-economists-value-in-data-science-1f94723827c4)
Covers Econometrics. Economists 'have a unique set of skills that allows them to apply statistics in a very similar fashion to data scientists, while also being able to evaluate bias, externalities, and comprehend the math behind algorithms. Additionally, their experience analyzing businesses provide an ability to question and discuss the value of models relative to business goals.'
